kid friendly at all. seriously, don't bring them.\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. when the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. that means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). when i arrived in the gallery i

signs got me in the door. we had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. the decor in this place is total garbage. it is so tacky. the sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. and my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. it was disgusting and i should have walked out then. actually, i should have turned around and walked out upon entering but i didn't. so the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. i tell him i want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. really freaking simple, right? wrong! rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. how does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? i realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. no idea at all. after about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, i said \"you know what? that's fine.\", paid and left. all i wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son

belly that lured me in, of course) but these were seriously good. i guess i've just never had them cooked right--super tender and drenched in butter. least healthy vegetable ever, but also maybe the most delicious. the barbecue pork on a jalepe\u00f1o pancake was awesome too, but the brusselsprouts were lifechanging.\n\noh, and the beer selection here is interesting and varied, just like the

ordered  a combination plate which came with a chile relleno, a veggie taco and a rajas tamal. the veggie taco was the most edible thing on my plate. it cost $18. maybe i am being harsh because i am mexican and i know what mexican food should be like. i also ordered a guacamole appetizer and that was a 3.5 out 5 stars. in all, this place is way over priced for the quality of food they serve. good

actually great and a pleasure to speak with until his manager got involved. i've purchased/sold more cars than i've ever wanted to so i knew where i wanted to be with my trade in and where i wanted to be on the new purchase based on the current sales and rebates. the manager came in about $1000 lower than where i wanted on the trade which wasn't a deal breaker until he told us the price of the new truck. it was a few thousand higher than i had figured based on the incentives and i told him that i've already gotten better pricing in writing from other dealers but they were a little further away

some weeks are good, fresh and saucy. some weeks can be completely opposite. i never thought about writing a review until our experience last week. \nwe ordered medium chicken wings and hot trifecta 2 lbs of shrimp. the wings came out super spicy (probably hot) and the shrimp came out plain ( 99% butter and 1% spices). when we ordered we asked to make sure we have enough sauce but they came in almost dry. my husband and i love this place but we just never know what we will get that night. we just dodge the bullet and hopefully they will be better than last week. amazing food, drinks, service!\n\nwe started with what we thought would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table- what did we expect on a friday night?  they send text notification when your table is available (love that!). our table was made available much sooner than anticipated. the bloody mary was super delicious and came with several garnishes-including a nice snow crab leg!   our server, dawn, was personable, and while we could tell she was super busy, she made sure we were taken care of, and explained any expected delay!  the menu was amazing!  nothing sounded bad!  i had the snow crab boil with added vegetables (1 pound!) and corn on the cob with the trifecta sauce at level 3 heat. my companion, the incredible running god, was more adventurous and had the shrimp boil (complete with \"everything that shrimp was born with\" as our server put it-eyes, tail, legs) with the trifecta sauce in level 4 heat-\"angry ghost\". be prepared to sweat with level 4 spice!  the kiddo had the pepperoni flatbread which sounded like a horribly boring choice, but hey, what can i expect taking a moody tweenager who hates seafood to a crab shack!  the place was packed!  and for good reason!  it was our first trip there, but certainly won't be our last! i couldn't be more excited to have found this new place.   food was yummy and prices very reasonable. service was great and they even showed the kids the lobsters! will be back and will certainly recommend to all the people i know. felt as if i was in new orleans :) the craft beers are very good, but that's about it. the bbq had been sitting under a warmer far too long, and i wasn't really clear on the seafood/bbq connection. might be a nice place to hang out on a friday or saturday night drinking with friends, but the energy is lacking, the food is overpriced and not all that, and the menu doesn't make much sense. avoid any of the fried items on the menu since it's pretty obvious they never change their cooking oil and everything tastes the same-- terrible-- and is way over-cooked. their fries, cajun or otherwise, are like eating a mouthful of table salt. awful! stick with the bags and corn and you'll be ok. \n\nthere's really nothing special about the place that would recommend it over other similarly-themed sports bars in the area, and the manager could use a visit from jake tapper at bar rescue. no effort is made to make the outside patio tolerable during the summer so nobody eats there. what a waste. the restaurant itself is located way in the back corner of a strip mall where the confined location guarantees it will be like an oven. great hh and awesome catfish dinner for only $9! the king crab with the trifecta is my favorite. remember to order bread for all the deliciousness!! loved this place! \ni came for crab legs and was not disappointed! loved that the seasoning wasn't full of butter, the level one spice was perfect, steamed veggies were crisp with a flavor season that wasn't too salty. tried the allegator and frog legs for the first time- good, but not for me. i'm not that into fried, salty foods though. our service was excellent --thanks, tim! fun and laid back atmosphere, friendly service! oh, and we got to tag the walls which was fun!! i'll be back! \n*wish they stayed open a little later... this place is awesome! great service and good food. it's loud and that's how we like it. it reminds me of the crab shacks in ocean city, maryland. i love sea food and i loved the angry crab shack.  wife and i came in for a date night using a gift certificate and tried a bag with 2 pounds of crab, a grilled meat platter for 2 and an appetizer of gator bites.  i'm glad that the waitress explained that when you add spice to the bag hot means hot.  we ordered mild and that had me sweating a

agree they are superior to our denver bagels. montreal, what did you do in a previous life to be punished with such crummy bagels? seriously, eating these bagels made me want to start a public service campaign called \"it gets better\" and i'll recruit people in other cities to show you how good bagels can be. this bagel shop must be build on an ancient iroquois burial ground. \n\n seriously, on a weekend trip to montreal, i had a goal to try these legendary bagels. these things are shriveled up, flat and taste like someone left out the salt. matzoh bagels. blech. 4 hours later, they were inedible. \n\n i love bagels. i've had bagels in new york, boston, san francisco, seattle and i've even taught myself to make really good bagels at home (google \"peter reinhart bagel recipe\"). these fairmount bagels were a huge disappointment. if i made a batch of bagels that came out like this, i'd toss them out and try again. hope i save some other bagel loving visitor from shlepping up to this shop. st-viateur is better, as bagels and as human beings.\n\nmaybe a tough comparison, but was mildly disappointed with the cold, new york-y textured bagel ultimately packaged in bags by fairmount bagels.  in comparison, the fresh-out-of-the-oven offerings at st-viateur were transcendant, with slightly crunchy shells giving way to sweet steaming carb flesh.\n\nthat said, the bagel with lox and cream was excellent.  compared to ny, sandwiches feature maybe a third of the cream cheese volume, allowing for a more careful taste of the fish and bagel.  no onions or capers.\n\ncash only; fairmount takes usd, but at an awful 1:1 conversion (versus st-viateur's rough 5:6?).  bring your loons. the bagels are good but first they had me write down my own order and then forgot two bagels out of my order. after taking a $20 uber to go see them and coming back to find missing bagels was a disappointment. i asked that they check it against the list i gave them and they blamed it on me for not calling my order ahead. hmm, i really don't know what the fuss is all about.  we heard it mentioned on a few travel shows as being the place for bagels in montreal, but were a little disappointed that they only do bagels, no cream cheese or spreads, no coffee, cash only.  \n\nthe bagels are stacked up high for volume, and the place is a squeeze to get to the counter when it is busy.  but they are fast, and the bagels are tasty - i just don't think you can compare this place to others that sell the fixings and coffee.  and maybe that's the point here? and if you are a local, you buy in bulk and bring them home?\n\nbut if you are a tourist and looking for a cafe/bagel experience, pick another place.", "9Jo1pu0y2zU6ktiwQm6gNA": "coconut's fish cafe is a fantastic, five

employee not wanting to put much effort into work. that doesn't compromise the food however. the one thing that took me by surprise on my last visit was watching a gentleman pick up the wash rag off of the floor behind the cash register and start wiping tables with it. when we were leaving i asked the gal at the counter who the manager was and she said well he's the owner and pointed to the very gentleman that picked up the washrag and wiped tables. i said to him, \"i just watched you picked up the wash rag off the floor and start wiping down the tables.\" i'm sure (or hope) he teaches his staff restaurant cleanliness. you can tell he was embarrassed  (which was not my intent at all), but he did apologize. i think he will be more conscious going forward. i do not want this to discourage anyone from eating at this restaurant as the food is really good and we will definitely continue eating there. because of this however, i could only give it four stars. we have been there twice now.

i only went out there for a concert and the concert and this restaurant were the best parts of my trip.  i went in here accidentally, meaning, i had no clue it was bobby flay's restaurant. i was hungry and caesars palace was a across from where i was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, i walked right in with no waiting. (i will assume now that since its bobby's place this place can get crowded so i feel the need to note this was a sunday about 11:45am) once inside caesars palace, i went to the first restaurant i saw, which was this one.  i realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"mr flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). i know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nfood: fantastic.  i went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  it came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). i am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  i had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  the steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. overall very good. had a cappuccino too, also very good. i wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness. (i personally hate when waiters/waitresses, come back every 5 minutes, is everything ok is everything ok...sheesh can i enjoy my meal?) \n\nanyway like i said, i had a horrible experience in vegas and this and the concert i went to see were the best parts about my trip, very glad i blessed up on this place.\n\np.s.  take notice, i have never eaten in a celebrity chef's restaurant and noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on any table.  ha just a fun tidbit, i thought that was funny and very interesting, almost as if the chef is subtly saying \"you will not mess up my dish with your spices\" bobby flay's restaurant at caesar's palace.  tasty but with mixed reviews.  the first time i went there, everything i had was delicious.  the chicken and pork tenderloin were outstanding.  this time, i ordered the following - duck crepe (soooo good!), shrimp tamale (very flavorful and fresh), salmon (mediocre, at best... and our waiter even told us not to order it... but my friend didn't listen), and halibut (tender, flaky, not fishy at all... and so flavorful!).  the halibut and appetizers were my favorites and i would definitely go and order those again.  we also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!  sweet potato pudding (and i don't even like sweet potatoes!), banana pie tart thingy, and spicy peanut chocolate cake.  mmmmmm would definitely go there for dessert and the appetizers!!! \n\nyou need a reservation for this place. bobby flay makes delicious food. \n\ni have been to mesa grill three times, twice for lunch, and it's one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas. \n\nthe space is huge, so even on a night you think a seat might take a while, they can typically accommodate you, so don't skip this place thinking it'll be too tough to get seated. \n\neach time the service has been fantastic. \n\nfor lunch both times i got the green chili cheeseburger, which comes with some awesome spicy french fries. the sandwich has cheese, delicious green chili and picked onions. it's awesome and that's why i got it both times. \n\nfor dinner, i got the pork, and there's was absolutely nothing left on the plate. \n\nthe price is what you'd expect, but not outrageous. it's definitely worth the visit on your trip to vegas.\n\n5 *****. i have eaten here and in nyc a few times and it is delicious. my recent visit to vegas is what has brought my review stars down. went to the bar for a margarita. the bar was mostly full, waited behind a woman who was buying 5 margarita's and she stood there sipping on one for some reason while her friends sat a table. luckily 3 seats became available at the other end and the 2 of us sat. and waited and then waited some more. the bartender on our side never once acknowledged us. not even a glance for almost 10 minutes. she was getting a bottle of wine for man to take out somewhere. going into detail about how she could not give him the mesa glasses. i understand helping customers but sometimes a small glance to let one know you exist is all it takes for good service.i don't mind waiting but i do want to know we will be served at some point. but after 10 minutes of sitting there when she only had the 2 of us, the wine customer who already had his wine and a single man who was already served well that is not acceptable so we left. i am certain she did not notice or care but her attitude made me question another visit. i was real worried about eating here due to reviews saying the food was bland. it was anything but. we had the blue corn pancake with duck wow. for entrees we had the pork tenderloin sandwich and green chile burger. the pork was incredible, the burger had a lot of flavor but not green chile, this was probably the most tender burger i have ever had.\n\nwe ate here for lunch because of my concern. it was definitely worth going for dinner, we will be back. ok, maybe my expectations were set very high because this is a celebrity chef owned restauant.  the food was good, but i was not \"wowed\".  i would give it another try because maybe what i ordered was not the best choice on the menu.  i will check back after i give it another try. i am a huge bobby flay fan and was so happy to finally try his food firsthand.  at first, i was really turned off by the \"tex-mex\" concept and even the name \"mesa grill\" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and bobby delivered.  we came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.\n\nservice: \n5 solid stars!  the hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  we were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  i really loved our waiter.  he wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  he talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  it was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  i wish i caught his name so i can give him props!\n\nfood:\nbread basket - 2 stars.  they start you off with a variety of breads.  there was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that i can't recall.  all were very unique, but unfortunately, i wasn't a fan.  i didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  kudos for thinking outside the box though.  the butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.\n\nblue corn pancake - 5 stars.  this appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  there was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  the flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.\n\nspanish chorizo quesadilla - 4 stars.  this was larger than expected!  it is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  it's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  there's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  \n\nfor our entree, my husband and i shared the new mexican spice-rubbed pork tenderloin even though i was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye.  the waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though i'm not a huge fan of pork.  it wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  wow, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  the spice rub added a bit of heat, and i can easily say this is the best piece of pork i've ever been served.  it came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  i can't even begin to describe how good it was.  you just have to try it.  5 stars for this entire dish!!!\n\ni sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  my friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  the pan seared halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  i'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  \n\nall in all a wonderful experience.  glad i finally got to try one of bobby's restaurants! i love being proven wrong about celebrity chef-endorsed restaurants;  carnevino in the venetian put me off making fun of mario batali forever.  his emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   but this restaurant has done nothing for mr. flay's southwestern recipes.  \n\na friend and i had lunch at mesa today, and before i get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. \n\n  we assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the cobb salad.  and over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   my pork tenderloin sandwich with southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), i began to feel very ill.   i ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\ni think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  sometimes you irradiate yourself.  this was more of the latter.   a lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   i also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nsorry bobby, maybe you should return and retune. got a response from the manager via yelp. he asked for my phone number so he could talk to me.  i promptly responded and gave him my phone number to call me.  well, it has been a few days and no one has called me.  is this some sort of scam to get my phone number?  or do they just don't give a shit about their diners' opinions of their restaurant?  once again, i reiterate my point: this restaurant sucks big time in service and management. mesa grill is good, solid food.  the prices are pretty outrageous at dinner, but brunch/lunch are very reasonable. the mesa burger is great. also had the pork tenderloin which was really solid (should have been at $45+).  margaritas are excellent and its a good place to get a primer into tequila options.  i love the bread basket they bring....really really good. i have had dinner here two times, and loved both times!  personally, i think there is a lot of mediocre food in vegas, but mesa grill is definitely not mediocre.  we had dinner before seeing cirque's \"o\".  the bread basket, as everyone says, is excellent.  i had the partida margarita, simply divine.  my salad was great, with a little spice.  the spice rub pork tenderloin is the best pork i have ever had.  it was so good, we raved about it so much, that the couple at the next table both ordered the pork tenderloin as well, and thanked us profusely for the recommendation!  i was a bit disappointed in the pear upside down cake for dessert.  it would only get 3 stars.  but the total experience is still 5 stars. mesa grill is located inside ceasars.  its nice that we were able to make reservations for a party of 5 people.  when you make your reservation, you have to give them a credit card number to hold your spot.  \n\n we arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time, and we were still seated immediately.  i loved how the servers was very attentive and chatty.\n\n the complimentary bread basket was very good.  i loved how there was different selections (jalapeno bread, cornbread, walnut bread).  for an appetizer, we decided to try the chicken quesadilla, and it was really good.  i would highly recommend it.  \n\n we decided to order the 22 ounce chipotle rib eye steak for our entree.  the steak was huge and can definitely feed 2 people.  the steak was cooked pretty well.  i loved dipping the steak in the sauce.\n\n overal, service was really good here.  i really enjoyed the bread and apps. first things first - i like bobby flay.  i like his television shows.  i like his personality.  and i like his style of cooking.  so i ought to like mesa grill.  and in some ways, i do.  but there are also some issues.\n\nthe ambiance is bright and colorful, with high ceilings, lots of windows, and an impressive bar.  but the tables were packed in pretty tight.  hey, i understand why.  the place was full on a tuesday night!  if you can cram that many people into a space, and they still want to come, then it's just smart business.  but it isn't my taste.\n\nmy wife and i decided to try as many dishes as we could, so we shared a menu made up of appetizers and side dishes.  our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.\n\nsome dishes were what you might call \"just fine\":  the chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  the goat cheese queso fundido was better than \"just fine.\"  the chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  the smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.\n\nso, mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.  but when we go to a high end, pricey restaurant we really want nothing less than five stars, and mesa doesn't quite get there.  lots of vegas restaurants do get there.  so we won't be back at mesa for a while.  sorry, bobby.  we'll catch you at bar americain next time we're in new york. this was a great dining experience.  i had never been to one of bobby's restaurants and i can honestly tell you that i had very high expectations.  there were met and exceeded!  our server was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable and the food was absolutely incredible!  the appetizers were perfect, we had the ceviche and the tuna sashimi and it was great.  the drinks were pretty great too!  all in all, this was a great place that i would return to. the food here was ridiculous, stupid good, whatever the cool kids are saying. bottom line dayum. my wife and i wanted to try this place simply because we watch way to much of the cooking channel, and we love bobby flay! we did the dinner pairing. my wife had the sophie's salad and i started with the tiger prawn tamale, yum! main course was 16 spice chicken for my lady and i had the ancho chilie salmon, both stellar choices! my wife had to pass on the dessert since they pretty much brought out the largest portion of chicken ever served in a restaurant. being the gluten for punishment that i am i went in on the coconut cake, it was extremely decadent! even though we didn't have a whole lot of interaction with our server, the entire staff worked as a team which made for a pleasant dining experience. we walked in 15 minutes before the doors opened for lunch on a tuesday and were the only ones there.  by the time we left 90 minutes later, the place was packed and the line wound outside and around the corner.  and with good reason.  \n\nshe started with the sweet potato soup.  it was perfection in a bowl. sweet, creamy without being heavy.  my goat cheese queso fundido with blue corn tortilla strips was cheesy, slightly spicy, with more than enough chips. really tasty.\n\nshe had a mesa burger, which might be the best burger she ever had.  cooked exactly as ordered (rare),it was thick, juicy and loaded with flavor.  even the bun stood out.\n\nmy cornmeal crusted chile relleno had a delicious crust loaded with great corn flavor.  the pepper itself could have spicier to my taste, but the cheese and sauce inside blended perfectly-a well presented lunchtime treat.\n\nwe both preferred the burger, but not because the chile was bad in any way.  the burger was just that good.\n\nwe'd return. we always go to mesa for special occasion. absolutely love the dinner. we've been wanting to go for brunch and finally did. here's my comparison of the two:\n\nbrunch bread basket was better... which says a lot cuz i'm a sucker for the jalape\u00f1o cheese bread at dinner. but there's like some coffee cakes and oatmeal things and mini jalape\u00f1o muffins that were all delicious. \n\nif you go for dinner you have to get the cactus pear margarita on the rocks. by far the best margaritas we've tried to this day. also their side of corn is amazing but seasonal. the tiger shrimp appetizer and rough cut tuna nachos are go tos for us as well. \n\nas far as breakfast goes, we got both quesadillas (one with egg and one with salmons- i forget what they were called) and they were delicious. the sweet potato clam soup is also great, we've had it twice. it was better the first time but still very good. my waffles... amazing. i could have eaten a whole stack! my husbands potato hash benedict wasn't as spectacular. the flavor was fine but it was all one note texture wise. very mushy. the mango glazed bacon was good- take it or leave it. \n\noverall we are fans on mesa and always come back. usually we get a couple things we know we love and always try something new as well! our service has always been excellent. dined here with the family during our last visit to vegas. food is great! the waitstaff is extremely attentive and knowledgeable. a must restaurant to go to while visiting las vegas.\n\ni've always been a bobby flay fan and wanted to go here. the waiter was on point with his recommendations. he turned us on to the best margarita i have ever had. it's a partida blanco margarita. it had fresh lime juice and agave for sweetener. it was amazing. so much in fact that i looked high and low to find that tequila upon my return to jersey. luckily i found it.\n\nwe had a few minor temperature issues with the steak but they fixed it and even took it off the bill without me even mentioning it. that in itself will make me return there when i return. \n\nnow i'm hungry... we came here on a recommendation from some other foodie friends knowing we were top chef fans & loves booby flays style of cooking. it did not disappoint! i had the blue corn lobster tacos as a starter followed by the pork tenderloin, both were fantastic but i was stuffed! the serving size was huge for me, especially knowing i was going out later...big meals kinda make me wanna zzzzzzzz... anyways. yum. the place is really good. the only negative, and this just my personal preference, was that it was very noisy. so if you are looking for a quiet, romantic spot for dinner? this isn't it. but go with an appetite when you do! bobby flays place is exactly what'd you'd expect from the southwest flavor king. i ordered the corn tortilla soup and man it was spicy and delicious!  for the main i got the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. definitely a must try. you have to come to his place with the expectation that everything will have his signature kick to it. \n\ni came on a tuesday day time and there was still a small wait for lunch. i recommend calling in a reservation if you're dinning in for dinner. cuisine is outstanding - unique southwestern creations with excellent flavor.\n\napps\nhighly recommend the tiger shrimp & roasted garlic corn tamale - shrimp was juicy and the corn was a surprisingly perfect complement. pass on the blue corn bbq duck pancake, taste was fairly salty/heavy and one-dimensional. \n\nmains\nchile crusted rabbit was excellent - serving portion is manageable, plated with toasted couscous (excellent pairing) and fava beans. rabbit was perfectly roasted and flavorful, slightly gamey. there are only 3 steaks on feature - black angus ny strip, coffee-rubbed filet mignon and bone-in chipotle-glazed ribeye. coworker enjoyed the coffee-rubbed filet.\n\nsides\ncauliflower gratin with roasted poblano was delicious and creamy. double-baked potato with horseradish, scallion had a subtle horseradish note, which was a good complement to the meal. \n\nservice was attentive and helpful with recommendations. ambiance is fairly average. i highly recommend eating here. all of the food was great. for side dishes i tried several but my favorite among all was the corn. the rib eye was very tender and delicious. as far as dessert goes, there is only choice to make, the cajeta cake is superb. i do not know what all the buzz about this place is... poor service, mediocre and overpriced food. the sauces were very basic - no nuance of flavor, and actually very blah. we waited 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by waitstaff, and another 15 minutes to get our drinks. although we were very clear to communicate up front that we had a show to get to, that didn't seem to matter to them. i can recommend other restaurants in vegas - don't waste your hard earned $$ here. the food was good. the wait, even with reservations, was disgustingly long. but realistically thats kind of what i expected being as it's a restaurant owned by a food network chef.\ni had the 16 spice chicken, and it was a tasty entree. though, now that i am writing this review a while down the road, nothing particularly stood out to me though.\n\nhowever, if you want to dine in a big restaurant, owned by a big chef, and southwestern is your thang, i'd say check it out. gluten free friendly... the best halibut i've ever had!! my company had the pork tenderloin with a spice rub delicious! unfortunately the goat cheese queso fundo was not gluten free but my quest said it was the best.. with blue corn chips hot out of the fryer.. going back again", "qUWqjjjfpB2-4P3He5rsKw": "in the heart of chinatown, i discovered it enroute to kensington market one day. it's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. first experience was very positive - would definitely return!\n\natmosphere: small space. think banh mi boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. vibe is casual. free wifi is nice.\n\nservice: okay. staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.\n\nprice: average. depends on the size of pizza you order.the small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one very hungry person.  pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)\n\n\nfood: my friends and i were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. it wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised every other table around us only had pasta on them. guess we gotta come back to try! we did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. so will definitely come back.\n\nhere's the pizza we ordered:\n\npeking duck pizza - very tasty! rich flavours that work well. but it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.\n\nmargherita - good, but not the best. i recommend trying the more \"special\" toppings instead.\n\nshall return, and/or try other locations.", "d_q4avZYM1sOlQP7noJKVg": "always a fun outing to come for great hot dogs and all the fixings!  a great place to bring out of town company for a good lunch a new experience. after hearing about people rave about this place i decided to try it out for myself he other day. went online and saw the menu, saw the \"famous sonoran dogs\" and immediately wanted that to try. saw that they had an option to order and pay online to avoid the line and pick up quickly. heck yeah i'll take it! ordering through a phone call or going in would be better. put my order and a couple co workers order in online and paid. 25 bucks gone. another co worker left to get the food and went to the counter to pick up order. luckily he made it just as it started filling up with people. the employee at the counter didn't have any idea what he was talking about when he said he was there for an online order pickup. luckily i printed out my \"invoice\" as they call it and sent it with him. had it not been for him having that paper they wouldn't have taken the order. i get it, sometimes technology doesn't work right and you get missed. they realized and said sorry and made the order quickly. now for the food.. we were all excited to try this place as it was new for us all. every single item we ordered was made incorrectly. whether it was missing an item that was checked off on the invoice and paid for or just the wrong ingredient. there was absolutely no flavor in any of the food. it was literally bland from the tacos, to the burritos, even the \"salsa\" was bad. if you don't have taste buds then this place might be good for you. i on the other hand don't wanna do it again. this location mirrors the tucson location! same food, set up, and relish cart area. \nthe grilled green onion bulbs are so soft and yummy! the variety of the salsas are great! the sonoran dogs are authentic. no need to drive to rocky point for my dogs anymore. \ni'm not a huge fan of their beans tho. the parking lot is small. being from tucson i was happy to see this location open in phoenix.  i am a big fan.  the owner even came to our table to see how we were enjoying our meals.  go with the hot dogs!", "wkzWdo1mBqbzR2KPoXtWZw": "was a chicago style deep dish.  homemade type crust, good sauce. i ordered extra cheese, italian sausage, canadian bacon and jalepeno!!\nwas good and definitely filling!!!", "r4HkiC71nB9k8Fe8zIORFQ": "first time eating there and everything was so yummy!

to check in was a breeze everyone there was great i do recommend that you pay the extra 20 dollars for the renovated room. the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because every way you turned the staffed tried to sell my boyfriend and i a time share. dinner at the sushi restaurant was great well priced and the staff was attentive. we will definitely be back especially after all the renovations are done. this is a little bit off the strip, but the view is so nice, and the price is low! also, the champagne brunch is good! first & last time i'll be staying here. came for an event at the convention center & this was their hotel of choice. two biggest complaints i had was the heat never worked in my room & i called about it but nobody ever arrived. second, woke up in at 4a to hear a dripping noise. water was coming up out of the sink & spilling over onto the bathroom floor & on my stuff i had sitting on the counter. housekeeping came up but it took them calling their engineers a few time before someone arrived to fix it. needless to say not a fun experience at all. you can tell this hotel has some age on it & needs to be redone. other items of note - fridge had smelly food left in it from previous occupant, no free coffee in room, trash by the elevator never emptied & it reeked. i'm sure there's more but my tired brain is done.", "ZbHE1ZncONeH-q93GuVGdA": "horrible- unclean, rancid, foul odors, unkempt, and poor service. the restaurant was nearly empty, and the cashier didn't even look up to say hello as my husband stood hungrily grinning at the counter. needless to say, i talked him into driving up the road to the other location. this one is unacceptable. started out comparable to robertos, but has gotten gradually worse.super nachos barely have any meat on them!!

the price for the pita/salad is reasonable, but after the delivery fee of $3, it can be pricey. definitely a great option if i forget my lunch at home. i tried pita pit for the first time a couple years ago when i received a free gift card from work. i was flustered from beginning to end--- i handed the cashier my gift card as payment, and he just thought it was some sort of promo card. he then asked for my debit card, which i passed over. when i questioned him why my gift card did not run, he was very perturbed and snapped at me when he had to cancel and re-do the transaction. then, i ordered the gyro, which anywhere else would not require much description. well, i was confused by the fact that i was asked what i wanted on my gyro (um, the usual gyro ingredients?!) and that hummus costs additional (which is not ever mentioned at the register when ordering the gyro).\n\nmaybe i've never gotten over this initial experience, but i have yet to truly enjoy pita pit. i think the pitas are over-filled with meat and sauce and under-filled with vegetables. though initially tasty, i always feel very ill after eating here... i only plan on returning when i get dragged here yet

worth it.    our party ordered the short ribs, salmon and steam bass for our main entrees and each dish was outstanding.   will definitely go back to this restaurant when we are back in the phoenix area. wonderful restaurant.  service was the best we have had in recent memory.  michael was exceptional, friendly, talkative.  definitely had a passion for what the chef creates.  just about perfect.  \n\nas for the food, pretty darn good.  i had the scottish salmon and at first thought it looked a bit small but it was just the right amount of perfect.  super succulent with an excellent quinoa radish and edamame mix.  i was actually sort of surprised by how good it was.  went with the advice of the waiter and couldn't be happier.  the lady had the chicken which was probably the best preparation i have had.  super moist, served on an awesome bacon stuffing....could have eaten a bowl of stuffing all on its own.\n\nsince it was her birthday we had the s'mores.  which the house comped; a total surprise and it really just rounded the night out to perfection. great drinks, friendly staff.\nmenu is very pork oriented (a major plus).  everyone at my table was very pleased with their main courses, but the bacon and cheese biscuits were dry.\n overall, great place and i will return. we went to beckett's table the first night of az restaurant week.  the atmosphere is a little like chelsea's kitchen, but i really liked it.  my husband and i started with the chopped salad and the chicken meatballs.  the salad was super fresh, really nice.  the meatballs were amazing.  the sauce was very smokey, which actually tasted better the longer it sat, the meatballs could have been served \"naked\"...they were delish!!!  we both got the green chile stew for our entrees, my husband enjoyed it, i thought it was a bit on the sweet side, especially as it cooled off.  dessert was the s'more with chocolate covered bacon, a dish you definitely have to try to appreciate.  took a few bites to get used to it, but it was really tasty, the marshmallow was fantastic.\n\ni look forward to going back and try some other things on the menu. birthday dinner #2, first-timer for beckett's table, i guess i just wasn't impressed.\n\nsunday night around 7, the restaurant is about 40% full with a couple of patio tables. we were greeted warmly and taken to the table. interesting enough, the first thing i noticed here is the deco, very contemporary american diner setting, yeah, that's how i could describe. the dinner tables and chairs are clearly divided into two colors, beige-ish or dark chocolate-ish, somehow there were no specific color match arrangement or setting, it was a bit random to me.\n\nwhile the hostess was very nice, our waitress had a i-do-not-want-to-work-on-sundays face, i think that just described enough. my entree was the butternut squash risotto. the presentation of this dish was good at a first sight, but when you look at it closely, i don't understand why the fried almost turned black brussels leaves are floating around, it was oily and tasteless. if you want to add a touch of green to the dish, maybe don't fry it as much so it would stay at green. overall the dish was too salty for me, and a bit too rich as well....though my friend enjoyed his shrimp and sausage dish very much.\n\nmaybe next time... visiting phoenix from central pennsylvania. saw an advertisement in a travel magazine, was initially skeptical. menu online looked good, plenty of gluten free selections for my wife (easy to read, well labeled). made a reservation online, noted that one party had a gluten allergy. arrived early, friendly staff who graciously accepted us early (we arrived about 15-20 minutes early). did not pawn us off on the bar, but instead asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. we picked inside. outside had nice variety of tables and a nice open fire, great \"foody\" smell that really drew you in. once seated, team member came over with glasses and poured water for us. menu was great, server came over and noted the allergy and went through the menu with my with my wife and discussed substitution options. great drink menu, good selection. great timing of appetizers and entrees. my wife had the salmon rillettes, which were absolutely delicious. she also had the cast iron petite chicken (with mashed potatoes instead of the stuffing). great presentation, chicken cooked perfectly, great flavors. best mashed potatoes that i have ever had in a restaurant. i had the beckett's table signature fork tender short ribs. also got a side of the wood oven roasted bacon biscuit stuffing. all i can say is wow... truly fork tender, and truly awesome. i love stuffing, sad but true. this was the best stuffing that i have ever had. presentation was perfect, stuffing side came in a small cast iron dish. nice little aside, there are pig figurines throughout the restaurant. when asked, learned that folks have been ending them since they opened. awesome little thing that is fun to check out all around the restaurant. i would definitely recommend, and hope to make it back sooner rather than later! we came here with 2 other couples. we usually eat out once a month. we made reservations 6 weeks ago. we were all looking forward to eating at becketts table. we sample a different phoenix restaurant each month. this is the 6th restaurant this year that we have tried. the restaurant was the right amount of noise. we were able to carry on decent conversations here compared to some other places we tried. the beet appetizer was like nothing i've ever tasted. the sweetness of the beets and the spice accompanying it was unique and delicious. the mac n cheese appetizer was creamy and comforting. \nmy husband and i split the chopped vegetable salad. this was very refreshing in the summer heat. \nthe pork ossobucco was tender and a little too salty. it was accompanied by a spaetzle which was even more salty. the beef short ribs were tender and tasty. maybe a touch too much salt. \n3 people at our table had the salmon. it must have been good because they did not say a word. \nthe broccolini side was perfect as far as sides go. i'd like to go back and try this place again.", "7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ": "there wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... it's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. there are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.\n\nsome others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. the asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.\n\nthe worst part is that when i was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on top of the pizza... so all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! there were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. i would have discarded the slices.\n\nmy husband and i both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment. food taste ok. i like the pasta selection. however, there is no seafood choices at all. if you are looking for seafood, skip this place. i was staying across the street at the wynn and my post-disneyland half marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so i suggested we check out ti for dinner. i think the buffet at treasure island used to be called dishes or something and i remembered it being pretty good. unfortunately, \"the buffet\" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.\n\nfirst, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. the slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. the turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. speaking of salty, i was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. there is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. and finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. on the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and i enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\ni hope this buffet gets their act together soon. sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at ti in a long time and i couldn't stand the smell of the casino! they pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. yuck worst food experience ever.

swear you can fit around 12+ people if thats what you want to do ;) they also have a tub in the middle of the room so you can watch your girl take a bath? lol the place was beautiful but was it worth the $2000?? i'd say yes, but the only major downside is that it's far from the strip. would i do it again? probably not since you can get a nice suite for the same price at a nice hotel and be on the strip. another downside was that you cannot go out onto the patio. they lock all the sliding doors. that was a big downside for me! after checking in and having a few issues, the staff upgraded me and put in the best suite i've ever been to in vegas. it has everything you need plus its fly! keenan the concierge man was so helpful in getting everything situated. i have stayed here on my last few

start and for mains the penne bolognese and margherita pizza. \n\nthe waiting game was okay, we got our appetizer about 25 mins of waiting. once arriving, the first thing i noticed was how small the mozzarella ball was compared the he richmond hill location. however, it was delicious ! i was reminded on why i chose this restaurant for dinner. \n\nas for the mains, we waited and waited and waited.

would come back to scaddabush. possibly just for the mozzarella balls but as our mains were just okay and nothing special, wouldn't choose this location for a full dinner again. my second visit here was much better because i ordered the right dishes this time i think. the carbonara pasta was pretty decent and the caprese salad was delicious once again. the naked mozarella was awesome and very unique. this place is a solid 4/5 as long as you avoid the spaghetti and meatballs (overly salty) and garlic fries (overly sour). the service was great and the atmosphere is pretty nice too. i went here for my birthday.  it was my first time experiencing this location and have to say i am willing to drive the distance to come out here.  the service was excellent, as a guest my experience was

are looking for something refreshing and delicious, this is your one stop shop! i've tried two drinks here and their delicious japanese styled crepe that was filled with nutella and mouthwatering strawberries and bananas. there are other options as well. their drinks are very customizable and if you think it's not perfect even after you get it, you can get it adjusted. the service is super friendly and the aura is welcoming. it's a clean environment where all the senses are in for a treat though the mesmerizing smell from the freshly made crepes, the refreshing sip from their drinks, to the perfect texture of their boba. i'm not from the area but anytime i'm on my way to vegas, i'm stopping by first to get my boba fix. \n\ntry the hawaiian paradise. you won't regret it. so the guys told me they steep the fresh brews for 7min. if you like your tea strong like me, order any fresh brew for 10 min steep and the drink half sweetened with honey. bomb. \n\nupdate: crepes are bomb. i'm used to a crepe having only the stuffing on a small mid section on the half of the crepe. but these crazy  people put the toppings on the whole complete half of the crepe and then fold it in that typical crepe way that it feels like it's a crepe cake with fruit and nutella layers. boom really friendly staff, very willing to make adjustments or re-make your drink to your liking. \n\nbest boba in town, soft and chewy (even in cold drinks 30 min later), nice honey and brown sugar sweetness...not too sweet and definitely not bland like some other places. \n\nvery good tea flavor and great tea:milk ratio. tried the okinawa milk tea (not as heavy as hokkaido and more tea than milk flavor). loved it! this place looks so nice place to chill with friends! people working here were pretty nice too, the server explained me the stuff about the drinks. i ordered the matcha milk tea and dang, that was so good. the boba is really fresh and very chewy, this is so different from any bobas that i had before! location: located in the albertson next to a vapor store. plenty of parking space. \n\ndecor: nothing special. but clean and their service is great. if you do not like your drinks, you can exchange it with no question asked. that's great customer service especially if you pay $6 for a drink. \n\ndrinks: their specialty is fresh brewed tea. however, they also have smoothies and coffee too. their smoothies are not from fresh fruit so do 't expect healthy fruit drinks. the coffe is ok, not strong enough for me. my favorite drink here is the jasmine latte. i love how you can customize the sweetness, or add any toppings. \n\nprice is expensive for tea drinks. but you get what you pay for: freshness, great taste tea and service. \n\nwill be back and for that i give this place 4 stars! my favorite is okinawa mt or rose mt, lychee peachy has been homies favorite.\n\nand i've gotten 3 completed stamp cards from here... \n\nso enough said, just go try it lol i have nothing but great things to say about brew tea bar. hands down one of the best boba places in vegas. i've been here so many times that they know me by name. i've tried their milk teas, slushes, hot tea, & crepes. you can't go wrong with getting anything from here. i will say that the salted foam that they put in some of their drinks is an acquired taste that i have not yet acquired. but, that's just me though. they have a stamp card too so you can get a free drink after you buy 10. i easily went through 2 or 3 of those cards. :) my favorite brew tea great friendly service and always ask if you want to make adjustments if it's not right. i'm from ca where we have many boba joints, but this one is my favorite. my 3rd time to this place and i've been to the eastern location once. since i discovered brew tea, i always pay a visit very time i'm in vegas. \n\nservice: fantastic. the staff here are very friendly and accommodating, even when they are busy. if something isn't right about your order, let them know and they'll fix it in a heartbeat, hassle free. they do it with a smile and apologize profusely. i appreciate businesses that own up to their mistakes, and make every effort to make it right. \n\ndrinks: the brew milk tea with grass jelly is what i normally get. delicious! i have tried jasmine milk tea, and that's great as well. my other half got the jasmine green tea and he liked it. overall, great!\n\ncrepes: i've had both the classic and berry lovers with whipped cream and green tea. so tasty, i love it! \n\nwill i return? definitely \n\ndo i recommend? absolutely i don't think words can describe how much i love brew tea bar! what makes it even better is that it's only a couple minutes away from my house! i literally go here every day, it's pretty embarrassing..\n\non my first visit, i ordered the honey milk tea with honey boba and pudding, which was alright. i also tried their caramel slushy (i don't' know exactly what it's called) but it was waaaay too sweet for me. my boyfriend then introduced me to my favorite drink, hokkaido milk tea with honey boba (also good with grass jelly) !!! i'm so in love with this drink, you have no idea! it's all i ever get and i refuse to drink anything else, because it's that good. if you like milky drinks like i do, then i highly recommend getting the hokkaido milk tea! i recommend trying their crepes as well!\n\nnot only is their boba perfect, but they also have excellent customer service! i love how they are willing to adjust your drink to your liking. i also love how the employees remember me and my boyfriend! we come here so often that sometimes they give us a large instead of a regular drink, which is awesome!\nthis place just has really chill vibes and a friendly environment. i don't think i'll ever go to another boba place, because this is honestly the best one we have in vegas.", "nJcyfIRGbI31EGLzillWYg": "a margarita in clear plastic dickie cup??? wtf?? the drunkin shrimp plate

give my business to the small town. lights were equivalent to a tanning booth. led lights do come in many different wattages. tvs were way too high up.  thought i was in old country buffet.", "KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA": "i have been coming to this sweet little place for years and think they deserve my compliments.\nthe food is french in a not too serious and snobbish way. \nthe wine is best enjoyed outside in the evening overlooking the \"lake\". they have live music (jazz guitar or piano) outside in the evenings most nights as well. probably,one of the more romantic night spots on the west side. \nthey also have a fantastic lunch menu, with a lobster salad croissant that is true bliss..... mmmmmm....\nlook them up for their specials, like wine tastings and discounted days. we regularly went to marche bacchus for many years. the french food was excellent without being too expensive. i used to eat their filet mignon. they changed their chef and booom, no good anymore. because we love the ambiance so much, we still went and had their pate, french fries and their wonderful crispy baguette/brea that is the foundation of french food. now they changed their pate, taste like the one at vons, they do not have their crispy bread anymore, but a mushi bred like in any cheap restaurant. the american owners who bought from the french owners do not understand what french food is. the ambiance is stil great, the service is amicable but the food remind me of mary calenders. shame on you for not maintaining the quality of food we had when you took over. everything about this place is awesome... the ambiance, the wine selection, the food, and service... if u r looking for a perfect date....or trying to impress... brunch, lunch, or dinner... this is the spot on every las vegan's \"off-the-strip-dining\" list probably lies marche bacchus, a charming bistro and wine market overlooking a peaceful lake away from the main strip.  the diverse french cuisine will appeal to francophiles, and the comprehensive wine selection will appeal will oenophiles.\n\nthe french have always done brunch well (partially due to their social belief that drinking after 12 pm is acceptable, even admirable).  marche bacchus is my favorite place to go in vegas for a brunch that makes me forget i live in the mojave dessert.  also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.\n\nif it's spring in vegas, i order the moules frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that marche does well; don't forget the mimosa.  \n\nif it's summer, i order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a riesling from the market; the sweetness of the riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.  \n\nif it's fall, i order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it's a calorie splurge but completely worth it.  \n\nand if it's winter, i get the les oeufs en meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it's a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of cotes du rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it's vegas harsh dry winter.\n\ndessert is their weakness.  i haven't fallen in love with any marche bacchus sweets; although i daydream about imported truffles from la maison du chocolat or patrick roger whenever i visit. i should have learned my lesson last time i was here for brunch when i had a bad experience with both the service and food...however, i thought it was just an off day, so when they advertised for their doubleback wine dinner i just couldn't resist.  service was non-existent, the food was not good and the entire event seemed like it had been thrown together at the last minute - very disorganized.  such a shame the way this place has gone downhill. what a surprise.\n\nwalking up from the outside, i was a little disappointed about the place - thought it would be \"outdoors\", when it's in the center of a non-descript strip mall.\n\nbut once through the automatic front doors, you're transported into a cozy wine celler at first, then through to the comfy restaurant/outdoor seating area.  totally not what i had expected from the looks of the exterior.  \n\nfrom moderately priced champagnes to ultra high end bordeaux, they have a large variety of great wines.  you can even purchase a bottle and open it on the spot for a $10 corkage fee.  \n\nhad heard the food was good, which is why we came - and i was not disappointed.  since it was sunday, it was mostly brunch items, but pretty much everything we tried was very tasty.  a few dishes of note:\n\n-buckwheat crepes: savory crepes are usually salty due to the sauce that's poured on.  not the case here.  crepe was soft and tender, with the chicken and mushroom going together nicely, and a light thyme creme sauce to tie it all together.  \n\n-croque madame: frenchy countryside comfort food.  love me a good thick piece of bread, and boy, their pain di mie was amazing.  thick cuts of ham and two gooey over-easy eggs to tie it all together.  yum.\n\n-lobster salad croissant: there's something really good about home made pastries and bread.  no corner cutting here.  fresh lobster meat, mixed with creamy avocado, piled on top of a fresh baked croissant.  \n\nthe kids really dug the lake view and hung around quietly watching the turtles swim around, while the adults ate and socialized.  overall a great experience.  highly recommended if you can stomach the drive into the heart of ssummerlin. beautiful views of the lake, sat outside it was nice and relaxing the service was very slow. ordered the chicken and waffles which were the highlight it was so awesome!!! the eggs benedict on the other hand needs help. the salmon was extremely salty!!! but i was starving and i wasn't going to wait for another dish. overall i would go again and try other things on the menu.", "77KuSFMOXqRGqcV9NJjzDA": "food was piping hot, which is great!! had the buffet...and it truly is

thought everything looked super cute. bought 3 bread, the charcoal salted egg, an almond croissant and a coffee walnut bread. all three, after discount came to almost 20$. i was quite excited but upon trying them all, the croissant was pretty good (but i've had better, ie nadege, etc) but the other two were very mediocre. the salted egg bread was very one dimensional as the bread itself wasn't very flavourful. i thought it would be closer to a moon cake concept where bread is a bit sweet and counterbalanced the salty egg yolk but instead the egg yolk overpowered everything else. the walnut bread was also very weird as the coffee had a weird after taste. \n\nfor the price i would def not come back.", "swX3Vj3dQsz1YlCRmwNQEQ": "great fresh seafood spot located in the scottsdale quarter. enjoying a nice dinner out and felt like seafood so we decided on this restaurant. we were greeted and taken to our seat right away. the restaurant sets a more professional, upscale type atmosphere.\n\nwe were greeted by our server and he took our drink order. we started with the seafood platter which had shrimp, oysters, lobster tails and a crab mix. love seafood? get this for sure! the oysters were quite large and not amongst the freshest i've ever had but they were still good. \n\nfor dinner we enjoyed the chicken and the scallops with a side if crab fried rice. crab fries rice was full of flavor and really good! scallops had a citrus flavor added which made it even more tasty. \n\nservice was above par as well. our server was attentive and friendly. \n\ni'd go back if i wanted a nice night out and craved some seafood for me eddie v's never disappoints.  fantastic service, incredible food, great choices, terrific atmosphere... this is now my go-to place for an overall grand experience.  they offer valet parking which i love... nothing worse than getting all dressed up and having to walk 2 blocks to get to your destination.  it is $3 plus tip... just an fyi.  we always make reservations just to be sure we'll get in.  if the tables not ready they have a very nice bar area to enjoy a cocktail while you wait.  both times recently our table was ready even though we arrived a bit early so we just sat down.  service is a+, first class all the way.  you can just relax and enjoy your dinner.  things i love, sea bass!  omg it is wonderful!  if you like sea bass... get it.  it is a huge portion and its usually market price...  last time i ordered it was $35 which i thought very reasonable considering the portion size.  very easily shared by two with smaller appetites. sorry... back to appetizers... oyster lovers love the oysters here!  they are on the happy hour menu in the bar area.  yellowtail sashimi is omg to die for.  heirloom tomato salad was fantastic too.  filet always a good choice... the asparagus was cooked to perfection and i would choose the augratin potatoes over the twice baked.  ive had both and i prefer mashed or baked usually but these augratin are wow... really great.  the sole is super!  it is a huge portion so unless you are a big eater or you are sharing... there is too much to eat but its prepared to a t!  it has a crispy exterior due to the parmasan crusting... and its delish!  oh and if you order a steak... you can order any way, any sauce, peppered, etc.... pretty much it seems if you ask they most likely can do.  just the way you like it! they also have live jazz playing in the bar area... very nice touch. i haven't been to eddie v's since their relocation from dc ranch to the scottsdale quarter, but i sure wasn't disappointed. i could not try ordering anything else besides the parmesan-encrusted sole and it has not changed it's culinary explosion of flavor one bit. the experience was romantic, the atmosphere was wonderful with a live musician, and we absolutely adored our waiter, michael. i definitely wish we had more of an appetite leftover from our entrees for the dessert options, but after two side dishes, an appetizer, in addition to the entrees we were filled to the brim. \n\nwe will definitely return. they have vallet service right in front of the door.  there is an oyster bar that's pretty small and a bar with music.  nice menu with your standard seafood steakhouse type dishes.  the portions are nice sized and the crab fried rice as a side but it's a must try.  the fish is fresh, the steak nicely cooked and the desserts are great.  the bananas foster butter cake is my fave.", "VMPSdoBgJuyS9t_x_caTig": "easily my favorite place to eat in madison.  great lao-thai food.  curries are fantastic and make sure to start with a soup.  they're always good.  tip: place is tiny and you will wait.  either get carry out or head across the street to the weary traveler to grab a beer while you wait for your table. it's a small little place, right there on willy st.  it's fairly cozy inside, with low lighting, but well chosen decor.  it's definitely not the best location for a large group, but if there's just a few of you, it's worth a stop.\n\nas with other thai restaurants, they've got a spice scale (1 star = mild, 4 stars = thai spicy), so you can customize the entree to your liking.\n\nnot being overly into thai/laotian, i went with a \"safe\" selection, a stir fry in a sweet and sour based sauce.  i went with moderate spice. it was definitely a unique taste, one i would highly recommend!  i wouldn't consider it traditional fare, there were more than plenty of options, if that's your thing.\n\ni was convinced to go in halvsies on a dessert of mainly coconut milk, rice, and cinnamon, topped with a slice of mango.  good thing it was in season! it's one of those unique dishes that, i have to admit, doesn't sound like the most appetizing thing until you try it.  however, if you get the chance, go for it - it's a unique dish you won't want to pass up.\n\ni'd recommend lao laan xang for anyone else looking for a unique, tasty, meal. some of the best

pretty excited after seeing the reviews, but it isn't anything special. the cheapest roll i got ended up being better than their more expensive rolls. the pot stickers were pretty good, but the sauce they came with...not so much. food is suspect but service is very good. haven't been there for a while but went a couple times in the last month. the nigiri had a bad odor and the chef did not do a good job trimming the fish. screaming o and jalape\u00f1o yellowtail sashimi were also cut poorly.  to top it all off the rice had a rock in it which resulted in a visit to the dentist to fix a filling!  i would choose many of the other local sushi restaurants long before this place. where do you go for some off strip sushi to die for? \"i love sushi\" of course. i didnt know what to expect especially from a place called i love sushi, let alone it being located in a strip mall. boy we're we surprised. this place was huge and had about 20 sushi chefs working behind the counter. the place was packed on a tuesday night. i think the place seats about 200 easily. wow. the food was awesome. awesome. the rolls were about $12-15 each but boy were they worth it. i guess one of the gimmicks of this place is the names of the rolls. screaming orgasm, taste like my ex girlfriend, fat a$$ special, and so forth. regardless about the name, the flavor was top top notch. this is definitely one of my favorite places to eat at. even though the names and description mention \"special chef sauce\", they are all different sauces that are highly recommended by the sushi chefs. i read somewhere there was a total of 81 chefs that are employed there. here's a list of rolls we had:\n\n(check out the pictures i added to the i love sushi page. warning: may cause a craving for some sushi!)\n\njackpot roll - i dont remember the exact description but its a fried tempura roll with spicy mayo sauce.\nspider roll - soft shell crab\nscreaming orgasm - seared tuna in chef special sauce\nfat ass roll - tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce.\ni love sushi special - spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauce\ndouble d roll - raw salmon and tuna on a roll and then into the yummy sauce\ndragon roll - lotsa lotsa unagi.\nbaked scallop mushroom we have been eating here for 5 years and though it is a little bit pricey for some things on the menu, you get what you pay for and what you pay for is the best sushi and service in nevada! \nthe staff is amazing and friendly- they know us by name and give my 5 year old hugs and high fives when we come in! i love the entire menu but if i had to eat one only one thing every day for the rest of my life it would be salmon lover no rice! best thing i have every eaten!

onions which were garnish for our joes special roll were spoiled and smelled bad. fish was not chilled so sushi did not taste fresh. did not care for it. being from la where they have a lot of good sushi joints it tool a while for me to find something good in vegas but here it is at last. i have been going to i love sushi for about a year now and never have i had a bad experience. its always

looked through the menus, decided what we wanted, chose our drinks, and tried to make eye contact with the staff.  \n\nthe last straw was when, after 15-20 minutes of sitting there without any acknowledgement, the manager came by and looked at us, instructed the busser to do something with the fireplace near our table, turned on his heel, and went back to hanging out with his employees.  we were looking for some sort of hint that he would send someone over, but we did not get it.\n\nthe worst restaurant service experience i had in paris was better than this.  i wasn't even mangling the language and we felt like personae non gratae.  we ate at lucille's barbeque around the corner instead, which was great. the food looked good from where i was standing... but unfortunately, i was unable to actually taste it.  i walked in there with my friends last night expecting to get a decent burger.  when we waked in, we stood at the front of the restaurant for over 15 minutes waiting to be seated.  it seemed as though workers were walking by us trying not to make eye contact so they wouldn't have to take the time to seat us. needless to say, we walked in unnoticed and walked out unnoticed. i was, prior to visiting, a little disappointed that i never got a chance to visit d'arcy mcgee's before it was replaced by bar louie. after hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.\n\ni decided to visit bar louie in early november while i was at tempe marketplace to watch a movie. i walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. i traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. i continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom i asked about seating. she retrieved a server and i requested to be sat on the patio. the patio was empty and i chose a corner table. my waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.\n\nafter bringing a menu back, i inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. i was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: new castle brown ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. i chose the new castle.\n\nafter receiving my drink, i ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. the \"four tacos plato\" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.\n\ni received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.\n\nmy only complaint was the portion size. the tacos were listed under the \"large plate\" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. they were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where i was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.\n\nall-in-all, i can recommend it to others, but i can't say that it is a five-star

was craving one and wanted to find out what yelpers out there think are the best.  i was a bit surprised to see reathrey on the list as they are not a vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, i decided to read through the reviews.  \n\nmy boyfriend and i originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in phoenix magazine.  our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  we ordered the mi keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but i never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  my only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  on subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  i have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other cambodian food to compare it to i find it to be just meahhh.  my boyfriend on the other hand loves the mi keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  in my opinion the pho at many valley vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.\n\nokay - back to

unacceptable responses to his less than stellar reviews.  i have three words for you get over yourself!!! i don't care if you are running a michelan star rated restaurant (which clearly you are not)

shrimp marinated salad/beef skewers/pot roast soup/fried tilapia topped with mango.  okay sounds to me like a typical cuisine, but no dude....it was awesome.  found out cambodian cuisine is not spicy like i thought it would be.  \n\nour service was great, this when the restaurant was booked by our entire group - kudos!  ambience was really homey - i gather if i lived in a cambodian household that

headed to the gym anyways, but started coughing horribly just as i checked in.  had to walk out to clear my throat then went back in and hopped on an elliptical machine.  the lady at the front desk was so nice!  she brought me a cup of water because she noticed that i was coughing so much earlier.  \n\namazing service!  now i wish i belonged to a ymca back home.  going to have to look into it

(a definate step up from pizza hut and domino').  the thin crust is we like here.  the crust has a crunch to it, which i prefer.  their menu has a \"tailgate\" variety of food (pasta, ribs, fried chicken, sub sandwiches......you get the picture).\n\nthe prices are bit high for what you get.  they do have specials so that is what our family typically goes for..... familiy feast ($22) includes 16' pizza with one topping, 6 wings, 4 garlic sticks, and 2 liter of pop.\n\nwe are planning to keep this place on our list of places to think about  for a weekday \"too many kid activities\" and \"too tired to cook\" take out night. stopped in for late lunch, and my son & i agree, this was freshest tasting pizza we've had in a long while!  the girls working here are extremely nice, waited on us, refilled drinks, and cleaned up our table when we were done, and kept smiles on their faces the whole time.  place is kept very clean too.  i'd definitely recommend! the food wasn't bad. we had pizza, ribs, and fried chicken. we are in town for an event and found them on restaurant.com. our server melissa was awesome. very friendly and attentive. i hope to come back.",

and we finally decided to give it a try. unfortunately the only good thing i have to say about the place is it has nice decor. we walked in and was greeted by one of the girls and as we were looking at the menu she asked if it was our first time and we told her yes. we assumed she would explain the menu but nope! my daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and i asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. so we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. my husband and i knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as\nwe looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. so we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. whew! it wasn't a long wait to get our order. my daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. to\nme the best part was the granola and that's about it. at least we can say we finally tried this place and we definitely won't be back. we will be sticking to our usual spot bowlology!", "AVdo7XPlyRZ_pj5DVk1Yow":

nail shop is in green valley & ever since i moved i was being lazy to drive all the way there so i decided to check this place out.. i just wanted to change my nail color (shellac) so i called and asked how much would it be and the guy said $20 so once i got there i picked out a color and told her i wanted silver glitter on the top. she picked out the glitter that was more pricey and didn't even tell me it would be another $5 charge.. i knew it was gonna be extra $5 because i get my nails done all the time & usually get that kind of glitter so i didn't mind but i feel like they should tell a customer ahead of time if there will be more additional charges.. and so when it came to paying she charged me $30 to just change the color without a manicure.. i asked her i thought it was $25 for shellac nail color change & the glitter and she made up some excuse which i couldn't even understand. so i will not be coming to this salon again because they just make up there own prices

was packed before the show, so we set on wandering mgm afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at crush. luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm i suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order asap.\n\nthe ambience is tres chic. dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. the only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) the syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a vegas bargain. we began with the caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though i myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. we then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. they were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. the speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. however, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.\n\nour waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. the end-to-end experience was more than i expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. this was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey. had a 11 person dinner there. service was good, but everything is over priced compared to quality. all the stakes and meet was over done (even when sent back to re do).", "4ZbRwCB9oGibxK21MUZKHA": "i went into this store yesterday and it was horrible!!! it was sooooo dirty. i'm talking there was trash

the were out of pretty much everything on the store. i honestly will probably start going down the road to the next smith's.", "rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A": "i love bouchon. it's still my favorite place to go hands down. they are extremly fresh and have excellent service. i ate at the bouchon in beverly hills and didn't encounter a single difference in food quality in vegas. the food has always been delicious and this one time i went we ordered practically everytihng. from the bakery basket in which the waiter chooses for us a selection of baked goods to the mussels to the hash. \n\neverything was delicious. and you can't beat the price around 20-30 a person with small apps. or aroudn 40-50 if your drinkin a little. very reasonable for what your getting.\n\ntake a peek at my photos.\n\nthanks thomas keller for a great meal again! well, it's doubtful that i'll ever get to eat at the french laundry so was happy that we got to try out his more casual, vegas restaurant, bouchon.  we ate here on the day before new year's eve so that may have been why we easily got a reservation at prime dinner time.  everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. \n\nsourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  one thing i hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so i really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.\n\nfor a starter, we split the terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  it has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  the slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. the prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  a dish i would definitely recommend.\n\nfor our entrees, i got the steak frites, and mark h had the leg of lamb (gigot d'agneau.)  mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  the steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  the onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.\n\nmark h's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  the roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  the lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  besides, i know he wanted to save room for dessert.\n\nfor dessert, we split the banana crepe gateau.  layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   this was pretty amazing as well.  i've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  the banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  the french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.  nice silky texture and oh so creamy.\n\nthe next time i'm there,  we really have to try their breakfast. my wife and i know breafast fare, and we think bouchon is the best anywhere, bar none.  yesterday morning was our second visit to bouchon - the first was a couple years ago.  the setting feels elegant and calm, in stark contrast to manic hustle of the las vegas strip.  my wife ordered the quiche du jour, which yesterday was a quiche florentine (spinach and cheese), served with a simple salad of lightly dressed greens.  i had the croque madame (toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce) which was served with more french fries than i deserved.  seriously, chef, you can pull back on the volume of fries.  but everything, from the complimentary bread served with butter and incredible jam, to the perfect quiche to the wonderful croque, was fantastic.  highly recommend.  only criticism was they were a bit snooty when my wife and i tried to swing by for lunch the day before - seems strange that they say they are open for lunch but close at 1 pm.  regardless, we can't wait to come back. had breakfast here, ate outside, beautiful and great food. the cafe au lait was really good, i had the eggs benedict with salmon and my wife had pian perdue (french toast) both were excellent, very well prepared and great plate appeal loved the bakery.. finally decided to try the daddy shop - bouchon (the restaurant):\n\n10th floor, venezia tower.. walked in here for brunch. the place had a classy decor, very professional staff and clientele were mostly upper class looking individuals. \n\nstarters:\n\nbread with butter, jam and ketchup?!: bread was shaped like a branch with leaves.. something like that. it was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. the butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup i guess was for the fries to come? who eats bread with ketchup?\n\ncheese danish - looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. this was so flaky/soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. this wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was superb!\n\ncroque madame: toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. served with pommes frites.. sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - in layman's terms = ham & cheese sandwich with egg and fries! toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. ham & cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor kraft cheese i use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy/frothy sauce, makes an incredible sandwich! fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. \n\ncorned beef hash with eggs and toast: corned beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. i scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. they were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice/sauce. the cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. the juice/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual real and typical corned beef i'm used to having. nevertheless, it was good. the toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a crouton. like a toast bread shaped crouton?!..\n\nfancy  place, great service, delectable food but came with a price.. $83.00 for 2 including 11.00 tip.. oh, it did include 2 mimosa's! cheers!! i think there is a lot of mediocre food in vegas.  even the big name places-- dull.  bouchon is very good but not quite outstanding.  i have also been to the napa bouchon, and would say the same.  well, except for that side of butternut squash.  the best butternut squash i have ever had.  the pumpkin soup was great, the scallops very good but not great.  our service was excellent.  we needed to catch an early dinner before the garth brooks show, and i was definitely pleased with our choice.  we'll be back! took us a minute to find it, but after some searching, we found it (located on the 10th floor of venetian). mrs. ninja's favorite meal is breakfast so we had to try bouchon. first, they served bread with butter and jam. something about the butter was so good, like they were slaving away in the kitchen,churning butter. for our meal, she ordered the chicken and waffles, not as good as roscoes, but still got the yes nod from her. i ordered the mussel in wine sauce w/ pomme frites (fries) and it was also very good. mamosa (champagne w/ oj) was good but i finished it in two large sips. definitely worth checking out if you dont want to stuff yourself with the buffet or if you need something to deaden a small vegas hangover. 4 hip to the hops! excellence. convinced my wife and kids to come to this \"french\" inspired place ( i think they were reluctant because of that) ... fast forward . everyone loved their meals. the ambience is relaxing, classy and conducive to anticipating something special. we'll come back breakfast at bouchon in the venetian.  we had croque madame, corned beef hash, and jambon et oeufs.  my croque madame was serviced with slice of brioche, ham slices, another slice of brioche with a sunny side up egg on top and a white sauce on top.  there may have been other stuff between the broiche slices, i just don't remember.   to fill, i mean really fill up the rest of the plate, a huge mound of thinly sliced fries.  i would have liked the fries to be a little more crispy.  the sandwich was good.  even though it looked small, it was a lot of food.  \n\ncorned beef hash was just how i liked it.  corned in small cubes, potatoes about the same size.  peppers and onions.  with your style of egg on top.  this is how, i think corned beef should be served.  5 stars for this meal.\n\nham and eggs were just ham and eggs, with some scallopped potatoes.  nothing special about this meal.  for some reason it was $25 and in my opinion, shouldn't be more then the other meals.  \n\nthe pan d'epi bread was good, with butter and the homemade jam.\n\noverall, a good place for breakfast.  good service. okay, we all know this restaurant is a love child of the most celebrated chef in america, thomas keller.  it is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the palazzo/venetian complex.  we also know this is mr. keller's \"bistro\" play, it has been much documented.  and i love french bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  so 2 stars?  here's why:\n\nservice: at these prices you expect excellent service.  we had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all i can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a chili's.  timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  clean-up was either too early or too late.  just a mess.  unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.\n\nfood:  yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  at the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  i had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  i could have sent it back, but given the service i didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  steak quality was mediocre.  had a endive/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  the walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  ostensibly there was some roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  i know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  nobody raved about their entree, in fact, i think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.\n\nwine:  a pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, i've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  but it was predictable, mainly french, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  very safe list.  if this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like cru bourgeois from bordeaux, a longer list of provencal wines, some unique choices from cali.  i could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.\n\ni've been here for breakfast/brunch, and i guess this is their speciality, it was super, a 4 or maybe 5 star breakfast, love that.  but for dinner?  a disappointment.  this restaurant needs an overhaul. my friends and i were very excited to have brunch in a nice french restaurant while in las vegas. however, our experience was quite disappointing.\n\nthe 20 minute wait to be seated was completely reasonable. but the 20 minute wait to get our order taken and then the 40 minutes it took them to prepare 2 sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and one pastry is unspeakable for such a high-end restaurant. we were wondering what took them so long to prepare our food and then realized it was so they could turn a \"medium rare\" steak sandwich into an overcooked piece of wood. we probably would have sent it back, but it would have taken another 40 minutes and we were very hungry by that point.\n\nour waitress did not offer much detail or information about the menu to our group, which was clearly not well-versed in french. she was also very slow to refill our water glasses, and when she did, the water was lukewarm. i was wondering if this was a french thing, but saw that other tables were offered pitchers of ice water.\n\nglad i decided to eat an egg and cheese biscuit in the venetian food court before heading up and waiting an hour to eat a $10 cup of soup in bouchon. for brunch, i love sitting outdoors at the patio. call ahead to check the wait time. it's a popular seating area. the roasted chicken & chive waffles are great. love the vanilla bean butter with the waffles. steak & frittes is also a favorite. with so may good places to eat in vegas our dinners were booked, so to sneak in bouchon we went there for brunch. \n\ni ordered the croque madame, toasted ham and cheese on brioche topped with a fried egg and mornay sauce.  the sandwich was just as you'd imagine, but the egg and mornay sauce add so much to it.  the mornay sauce was rich and velvety smooth.  the egg enhanced the sandwich the same way adding a fried egg to a cheese burger does.\nit also came with pommes frites, or in english, \"french fries\", and a whole mound of them!  so much that a table of 4 could not finish them.   they were really good, maybe in the top 5 fries ever.  after all who makes french fries better than the french?  well maybe mcdonnalds... wait, did i just compare bouchon to mcdonnalds?  anyway they were light, crispy, and delicious.\n\nwe also ordered french beignets.  i was expecting something like the beignets in new orleans where they are light and covered with powdered sugar.  these were a bit heavier and both resembled and tasted like cake doughnuts.  although they were warm and probably the best cake doughnut i've ever had, it was not what i was expecting and was a bit of a let down.  i would have been fine with it, but when it was brought to the table they said, \"your doughnuts.\"  let's get one thing straight here, i'd gladly pay $8 for 3 french beignets, but not for 3 doughnuts!  \n\npros:  great bakery items especially the croissant, tons of delicious french fries, delicious meals with great sauces. \n\ncons: beignets are okay but not the type you find in new orleans, definitely not worth $8 for 3 the size of \"hostess donettes\".   \n\nadvice:  there is a embosser next to the entrance with some pieces of thick card stock.  you can emboss the bouchon name in it for a keep sake.  not sure if you're supposed to do it or what it's for but i did, and now use it as my bookmark. we had an amazing brunch at bouchon! this will be on my must-eat list every time i go to vegas.\n\narriving a few minutes early for our table, we found ourselves waiting at their full bar, which is where our wonderful experience began. a melange of mimosas, french 75s and bloody mary's rolled out (hey, we were on vacation!), and the brunch festivities began. the bartenders know their stuff, are friendly, and prepared our drinks lickity-split. each cocktail was carefully made, and tasted delicious. drinks in hand, we were soon escorted to our table.\n\nthey were debuting a new menu on the day we went. i can't comment on the changes since i haven't seen the old one, but the menu had something for everyone. our server did a fantastic job of explaining the menu to us and making recommendations based on our preferences. the service was singularly outstanding! thanks to alonso!\n\nat our table we got the chicken & waffles, croque madame, salmon version of croque madame, steak & potatoes, and a variety of sides and pastries. every item was delicious and well prepared. the lyonnaise potatoes are an excellent side. chicken and waffles are the bomb. and the pastries - oh my gosh, the pastries! it wouldn't be wrong if you ate an entire meal consisting of their pastries. i wouldn't judge you.\n\noverall, a vastly superior dining experience, and a brunch to remember! good service, liked their seafood platter, and the ambiance was nice. i'd probably go back again if i were staying at the venetian. i had the most lovely brunch at bouchon during my vegas christmas wedding weekend. they offer very, very tempting brunch selections like chicken and waffles which looked mouthwatering. however, on this chilly vegas morning i was slightly hungover and craving a more traditional (non traditionally late) breakfast. the \"breakfast americaine\" fit the bill. it came with crispy bacon, the best breakfast sausage i've ever had, eggs any way you can imagine them, and toasted buttery brioche. in addition, it came with a breakfast pastry, juice and endless coffee.\n\nthe chocolate croissant was the best chocolate croissant i've ever had, besides of course ones i've made in my pastry career and eaten fresh from the oven. the banana muffin was very moist and very delicious. the coffee was amazing and overflowing. our waitress constantly warmed and refilled our cups. the service was great. i will be eager to return, next time for dinner! the existing reviews pretty much tell all...this is a beautiful, quiet space for any meal, but especially sweet outside on a sunny spring day with fragrant flowers in the garden in bloom.  we had a pricey, but deliicious breakfast.  as far as \"value\" in vegas goes (remember, you're in over-the-top vegas), bouchon makes my list. got the assorted pastry basket. fantastic. the berry fruit salad, also good. this place is solid on baked goods.\n\ntip: they don't take reservations, but you can call and get an idea on the current wait before trekking out there. out of all the places we ate in vegas, this stood out as the best value by far.\n\nnot that it was cheap -- no, no -- but we really felt that we got our money's worth here.  most vegas joints are ridiculously overpriced and serve food that, while good, isn't nearly reflective of the benjamins you lay down.  (look, i'm street!)\n\nso we started with the bone marrow and the p\u00e2t\u00e9.  oh, bone marrow, where have you been all my life when you could have been clogging my arteries?  the waiter (michael, who was awesome) showed me how to smear it on my bread.  yum.  the p\u00e2t\u00e9 was tasty -- but eclipsed by the marrow.  i had a sazerac and my wife had a moscow mule to accompany -- both top notch jobs by the bartender.\n\nthe main courses -- a lamb sirloin for the lady, and a kilo of mussels and truffle frites for me.  both were amazing, fantastic, to die for good.  the mussels were steamed in wine, mustard, and garlic with some ham thrown in for good measure.  the frites were served in a cone that had some decidedly non-euclidean properties to it -- no matter how many we ate, there were still more in the cone.\n\nlisten to the wait staff on the wine and/or beer pairings.  you're welcome.\n\nwe didn't eat dessert.  because we were full to bursting on the rest.  the portions are generous, so go hungry.\n\nfive stars, no reservations. this place is the real deal with a beautiful dining room, a professional wait staff, and the food and wine is outstanding. my wife loves duck and it was perfectly prepared. i had the sea ass and the waiter helped me pair a glass of wine. we laso had dessert and the waiter had the staff pick a perfect dessert wine to go with our dessert. just perfect. you will love it. service was just ok. food wasn't exactly horrible but i was expecting something so much more. the pastries were good. oh and the coffee! i still dream of the coffee... we will meet again coffee! i gave this place 5 stars only for the coffee. kinda wished i would of just ordered only coffee! we absolutely love the appetizers. salmon rillettes is a must! i saw the onion soup and could not stop myself from ordering one as well. the oysters were really fresh and started our evening with a bang. i was a little overwhelmed with the size of my entree, which was a trout. it was basically half of a trout. the cauliflower puree with white truffle was amazing with the fish though. our server was really nice despite the fact that it was super busy that night and there were some rude diners crowding the walkway by the tables. overall, a great experience. i want to come back! i had the pleasure of dining at bouchon last week for the first time.  will i go back?  certainly.  my beet salad was wonderfully refreshing, the moules frites excellent, and creme brulee great (can you really f-up creme brulee?  i hope not).\n\nmy husband had the french onion soup and blood sausage.  both were exceptional. \n\nthe service is top-notch and we will certainly be back again next year.  i didn't quite have same the earth-shattering experience that tony bourdain had over the frites- they were good, but got a little soggy as the meal wore on...  however, i was quite pleased that i finally found a restaurant on the strip that could make a gin fizz.  bouchon is worth the stinky walk through venetian for a great meal.", "gLOc1Fzl8yuKGq7B1TWj_A": "so pretty inside and well organized! i called for an appointment before my wedding for me and 3 others and was told they wouldn't be able to help me on that day because they were going to be too busy. :( so we went somewhere else. i had a gift card for here so i went here for my fill, and they did a great job, but a bit overpriced!

 no flavor at all, dry bun, tiny flat burger that looks like i cooked it at home and barbecue sauce was on the side in a little cup.  the only thing that saved this meal were the french fries and the free refill of beverage to wash the burger down.\n\nas far as i'm concerned, i won't be going back to that establishment for a $13 burger, fries and a drink.", "hsDkxhc-_YYsVqAeQBJJjg": "i saw big jim's on diners, drive-ins and dives. went there when in pittsburgh with my son visiting pitt, had a great lunch. \nmy son went to pitt and i have been back several times. the food is very good, large servings and reasonably priced. this place will surprise you. it is off the beaten path. you have to be looking for it because it is below the highway in a neighborhood that leads nowhere to my knowledge. it is unattractive at best but the service is good, food is very good, fresh, plentiful and very reasonable. if you like good food, funky places and you are not a snob stop in and give it a try.", "FodnfLi_ezVmL5DcrxnI3Q": "the worst hotel experience i have had...we came here tonight, and the bathroom shower is visible to he whole room. then we needed extra blankets and called down, they said they were all out. then we asked for water botlles, and they said they were all out!

i've eaten at a few of these.  they are outstanding!!!!  if you don't have one in your home town it's great. \n\nlittle known fact is they have a lunch menu till 2 that is much cheaper and just as great.\n\nthey definitely train their servers to be the best!  go. the service, the spinning salad, the prime rib.....it's all great every time we go to lawry's.  the biggest secret is that the rib eye is great too!  we'll be back again soon! i've been waiting a long time to try this restaurant. just hearing about it from friends and reading reviews on yelp made it that much more exciting. it's a very nice place, nice drive up entry and lobby, nice interior decor. it puts you in the mood for a nice relaxing dinner. our server this night was keith and he was very knowledgeable, prompt and patient. he explained everything from how the meal would be served, from the salad to the actual carving of the prime rib. you don't have to be concerned if you aren't sure what the various cuts of meat are. he said that when the chef comes table side he will show you the actual sizes. \n\nokay. first off, you get your drink orders filled, then you start off with your salad when you are ready. the salad is prepared table side on a cart with a large bowl in a bed of ice. the server proceeds to spin the bowl and tosses the dressing into it. they have a house seasoned pepper to put on your salad which is made by lawry's. very good and refreshing.\n\nnext comes the main course... the prime rib! yours truly opted for the diamond jim brady cut, medium rare which has the bone in. it' s actually not that big of a serving when you consider that the bone is in. i think it was a 16oz cut. it was done perfect and i had it with the creamed spinach. mashed potatoes come with it and the au jus is laddled onto your prime rib. oh, and don't forget the yorkshire pudding!  also, my dining companion and i decided on a sizzling plate of mushrooms which were saut\u00e9ed in butter and garlic. \n\nas for dessert, well, that was far from my mind at the time! it was a very delicious and satisfying meal. if you decide on coming here for dinner, i suggest you have just a light lunch that day, i did and i'm glad i prepared myself for dinner! i really enjoyed my dining experience here and what made it even better was the excellent service provided by the employees here. from the front reception area to the servers, valet, they are very friendly and cordial. give them a try when you're in vegas.", "atNpoWy_XrhT9EUIEP6azg": "i loved this place!!\n\nfirst, my drink was delicious!

i highly recommend this if you want a lighter low carb dinner, and it's much cheaper than the entrees and the portion isn't too much! \n\nambiance: a little dark for my liking and i went during lunch time. i sat by the window which made it bearable, otherwise it was way too dark. definitely will go back...best wonton soup i've ever had. i got the pai thai which my waitress said was the same as pad thai however i was not a fan....it was very soupy and tasted a little like barbecue sauce honestly. i would not get that again but i tried my friends food and everything else was delicious!

 had seen the place in family circus cartoons and it was neat to go in and have ice cream.  great menu with a lot of different things (not just ice cream).  super pleasant staff and a cute atmosphere made this place a winner.  left without finishing my ice cream and stuffed after we had lunch elsewhere.  it was an old fashioned ice cream parlor and was a pleasure. good ice cream put poor systems. one cashier for busy night with a line to pay 20 deep... it's looking a little rough around the edges but the iconic sugar bowl is still a favorite family event when in scottsdale! this place is amazing. old fashioned ice cream parlor and the ice cream is super good. really busy but any wait is worth it. terrible service. mediocre food. we literally spent 2.5 hours here just trying to have lunch. it became a case of weighing how much time we had already invested vs. 'should we just get up and leave.' we should have left. by the time we were done, most of the nearby shops had closed. i don't know what took so long, as the sandwiches were on par with something a 5-year-old could have slapped together -- white bread, mayo, luncheon meat, iceberg lettuce. our waitress  failed to bring salad dressing after two requests, so i went up front to get it myself. a bus girl said she would bring it. when she failed to, i went up front yet again and this time waited for her to bring it out of the kitchen. this experience has taught me to always check the yelp review first, not an hour into a bewilderingly bad experience.", "QC8cV2iUE7dtXW-CayBgUg": "i live in austin, tx and have an old 1992 porsche 968.  when i need parts for my car i call these guys directly. they find or get what i need for my car, and at a great price. lots of porsche dealerships and parts departments don't even know what a 968 is till they punch it up on there computer. next time i'm in las vegas i'm gonna go see the people at gaudin!

 we ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings, beef bejing pancake, and beef chow mein.  i'm not a fan of seafood, but i did try the dumplings.  they were really \"shrimpy\"  which i guess is the point.  lol.  the beef bejing pancake was interesting.  it kind of looked like a burritio that was cut into slices.  the outside was crisp and the inside was very flavorful.  there was something cold inside of it.  i didn't take it apart to see what it was, but it kind of threw me off.  it wasn't bad, just different.  i still ate it.  the beef chow mein was great and it was enough for me and hubby to share.  i also had shanghi wave (drink)?  i think that was the name of it.  soooo good.  we will definatley be back. i was expecting a lot more so that is why i can only give beijing noodle no. 9 two stars.... part of me wants to give it three, but i know better and i need to rate this as i would anywhere else.  \n\nthe sleek white modern bright decor is fabulous... looks great, but after sitting there it was too bright.  service was awesome.  food was at best meh (hence the two).  the one redeeming item was the corn and chicken soup (i think that is what it was).  \n\nalso... when you are not busy, please do not seat the screaming kid next to two of the only diners... they did this and it was incredibly frustrating.  i was with my boss so it was not as bad as it could have been had i been on a romantic date with my husband. ate there twice on my trip to vegas, but only had noodles (once with sauce, once in a soup).\nalthough it's a bit pricy for chinese food, i think the prices were still ok, based on the rent they might have to pay inside caesars palace.\ntheir freshly made noodles, especially the hand stretched ones, were really yummy. and to compensate all the bad food and drinks in vegas, i recommend a healthy stay at this place. this place has subpar food and exorbitant prices (for what it is) which is never a good combo. the first time i got the tomato and egg noodles, and those were pretty tasteless. ..not to mention they came in a tiny bowl and i was hungry an hour later.  the second time,  i got the chicken chow mein, which although greasy,  was decent,  after i added a good amount of salt and two packets of hoisin sauce. \nbottom line- save your $12-$18 and get a good lunch somewhere else.", "Jz4LZvTibMEzXx8nZX5Q7g": "some really great produce prices, which are what pulled us in.  we got a newspaper flyer from them last week and decided to check it out, based on that.  still, i kept thinking, isn't this the place [friends of ours] went to and said wasn't that great??\n\nthe produce is priced well but it seems like everything else is on the high side.  bulk food section was small-ish, i though.  i meant to bring a pen and paper to write down prices of items i usually buy, to compare rbn, wf, tj's, and eefco - but forgot.  but long grain brown rice was $1.99 here, which is same as eefco.  i think walnuts are more at rbn, though.  basically - don't believe the low price claims!\n\ni think we may go back for produce and that may be it.  free parking is nice, though - they cover 2 hours, which would give you a little time to wander, too.  parking is covered which is oh so nice.\n\none negative for families is no changing table in the bathrooms.   i had to change a diaper  on the floor of the bathroom on my husband's coat.  yeah, the floor was pretty clean, but still.  ugh.  not a good thing for families!\n\nupdate - they did eventually add a changing table, but i guess their low priced produce and high priced everything else model didn't make many people happy.  defunct!", "DYuOxkW4DtlJsTHdxdXSlg": "i love this place. ever since i frist tried it in atl.\n\nok. first thing first. you must order coconut shrimp (unless your allergic!)\n\nwe ordered:\n\nonion rings ( a must its frikkin huge and the sauce is awesome!)\n\ncrab, shrimp, mango and avocado stack crab (its frikkin good as hell.. mix it in the sauce that is circled around the plate they go perfect together!)\n\ncuban sandwich (eggs were missing from it for me but the bf said it was good)\n\n1/2 coconut shrimp & caesar salad.

the furnishings are very clean and modern and the room felt luxurious.\n\nthe best part of the entire room was the bed! it was easily the most comfortable bed i've ever slept in -- in my life! the front desk told me they are made by stearns & foster specially for mr. trump, but that he thinks something similar is available through the company. the sheets were high tc and the pillows and comforter were lofty and plump. the hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.\n\nmy complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free wifi ($12/day is a little steep and i felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo/conditioner wasn't very high quality. boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. my only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's vegas...what lobby isn't?!).\n\nall in all, i thought this was a fantastic value and, as i said, the best bed i've experienced in my life. i will definitely be back.\n\np.s. in response to those who say it's \"off the strip,\" it's not. it's on the older part of the strip (near circus circus), but it's not technically \"off-strip.\"  also, when it's 110 degrees outside, i don't know who is actually walking from casino to casino, anyway!!! seriously? doesn't everyone take a cab everywhere? now let me start with the good.... \n\n1. great location\n2. very clean\n3. most comfortable bed in vegas\n4. fashion show mall is literally right across the street\n5. large rooms\n\nthe bad....\n1. noisy. train comes by 3 times a night and it is loud and they honk as they are going by.\n2. pool is just ok\n3. rickety pull out sofa creaked all night\n4. not 5 star property like priceline said\n\ni would stay here again if a deal popped up and my trip didn't revolve around the pool. i love a clean non smoking hotel and this definitely beats my go to jw marriott in summerlin so many great things to say about this place, but it didn't hit everything so that's why i had to mark it down one star. check in was reasonable and the staff are friendly. at first i was taken back by the mandatory valet, but i like that it's based on gratuity/tip. i love that it's smoke free and still basically on the strip. the one bedroom suite is super spacious and could honestly comfortably fit four adults if tight on cash. rom service provides good portions for the money and is prompt. so the markdowns come for the cleaning and the gym. there were two obvious strains on the curtains, which i know if i can see, housekeeping should be able to and thus clean! also, i was curious as to why there were a pair of men's dress shoes under the bed. did housekeeping vacuum under the bed??? clean with their eyes closed?? i dunno. also, my friend went to get extra pillows from the closet and said there was hair on them and they were dirty...not acceptable. lastly, i do workout everywhere and was slightly disappointed from the size of the gym. i was still able to get a mini workout in, but i guess i was expecting more variety and no kids. typically this would be 3 stars bcuz if the cleanliness, but the customer service and space superseded the issues this time. politics aside, the trump hotel was a very good experience. we were in town for an event at the convention center. \n\npros:\nfriendliness of the staff! from check in to check out, they were unbelievably accommodating and friendly. \n\namenities in the room. full kitchen (which is the reason we booked there to begin with. a lot of places in vegas do not have a kitchen). it had a sink, fridge, toaster, stove top, tea kettle, microwave, keurig coffee maker, and cabinets. as a nice touch, they had rio blend coffee in the room. maybe because of the 2016 olympics coming up? also had paper coffee cups, sweeteners, creamer cups, and stirring sticks. due to county regulations, they are not allowed to keep plates, silverware, etc in the room but will bring them to your room if needed. \n\nthey also included an iron, ironing board, blow dryer, light up mirror, bathrobe, and plenty of fluffy towels. \n\nthe bathroom has a tv inside the mirror. didn't use it but interesting touch. spa tub and separate shower. marble counters and floors. water heated up very quickly. \n\nthe pillows!!! oh the pillows! i have to find the downrite brand online or in macy's or something because they were divine. beds were comfy too. \n\nour room even had a doorbell on it instead of the bellboy knocking, he rang a door bell! lol\n\nthe ac was amazing and cooled the room quickly and kept it cool. \n\nvery quiet. we never once heard any other guests. all the appliances in the room were quiet as well. \n\nthe elevators. fast. ya know how some hotels you stand there forever waiting on the elevator? not here. i timed it. it took 13 seconds to get from the 39th floor to the lobby. unreal. \n\nthe ice machines are in their own little rooms in the hallways so you don't have to listen to someone getting ice in the middle of the night. \n\nit is right across from a huge mall. lots of shops and a large food court. \n\ncons:\n\nthe train. yes, you read that correctly. there was a train that ran behind the hotel where our room was facing that ran every couple of hours throughout the night and woke us up each time. as it came up to an intersection, it would blow its horn over and over. but this is where the nice staff came in handy. they were more than willing and helpful to move us to a room facing the strip in exchange for a small extra fee because it was a room facing the strip. we could still hear the train in the distance but not enough to wake us up. we only heard it before heading to bed. \n\nvalet. yes, i know that valet was supposed to be bougie and helpful, however, we found it bothersome. it's just easier to have access to our car when needed. on the other hand there was a relatively short wait time so it wasn't too bad. however, that depends on your timing. some times of the day were very busy. \n\ninternet. it was a bit slow. so if you are someone there on business who needs fast internet for work, this may become an issue. \n\nsleeper sofa. we pulled out the sleep sofa that our original room included. for a 5 star place, there should be a nicer one. it was just your run of the mill, feel every spring, mattress. \n\nno casino. for me personally, this was not a problem but if you going to vegas to gamble, this may be an issue for you. \n\nnot on the strip. the only reason this is a issue is because of the heat. if you want to go out and walk the strip, you also have to add to that walk because you have to get from the hotel to las vegas blvd. it's not too far but the heat is what does it. \n\ni may not agree on his politics but his hotel was top notch. would recommend.", "JZwPJyoJnqlfjCsrnSUmNw": "delicious, delicious, delicious. zuppa's deli always has a clean and friendly atmosphere. their food is cooked to perfection & ready in a time efficient manner. they always have kind employees which makes the atmosphere even better. they offer many options with mixing & matching meals. their menu is one of a kind. 5 out of 5. the two guys that run this do a real solid job.  one of the better if not the best deli's north of the city. this is one of our go-to places for lunch at the office!

she was so sweet and attentive! she also suggested the really yummy goat cheese app and my fiance also loved the blackened fish tacos she recommended. i have wanted to eat here since moving to vegas, but it hasn't worked out. after \"checking in\" i found the timing was wrong given my new wardrobe addition of a foot and leg cast, very awkward foot boot, a walker and terrible parking with a long walk to sit down for dinner. after a couple of circles around the place we decided to give up this time around and try again when the cast is gone and there is less of a crowd. guess this is the long way of \"checking out.\"  four stars because that many people with four and five stars can't all be wrong. wow! amazing. met up w/ my bestie tonight @ town square. we were both hungry so as we walked past the tommy bahama resturant. we asked to peek @ the menu & the host at the door was very clever.  i totally wish i remembered his name...my bestie thinks it was corey but either way you were awesome!

today my boyfriend and i stopped by to buy some dog food. i usually just get a big bag of pedigree at walmart, but i decided to explore other options. as we were looking at the different bags, wesley one of the employees, offered to help us. this guys has vast knowledge about all the dog food brands the store carries. i was really impressed, especially when he asked about my dogs in order to give the best recommendations on dogs food. once we got our bag picked out, he also informed us about how to go through the process of changing out the dog food since pedigree is all my dogs have ever eaten. when i asked how he learned so much about dog food he said he's been working at wag n wash for 5 years. to me this is a plus because you wouldn't go through the effort of learning so much for a job you don't enjoy. also, this tell me he does like his job and he's willing to learn to help the customers. we searched for a place with healthy snacks and food for our pups and stumbled upon wag n wash. as soon as we walked in we were greeted by all the associates and we were helped by brittany (pretty sure that was her name) she was super helpful in helping us find the perfect harnesses for our puppies. she even tried them on for us. we also got a complete tour of the store. i'm so excited to come here for our pups birthday cakes!

 i don't think they do that kind of thing at a black angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  \n\nmy steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  the sauces weren't special but i'm not much of a sauce guy.  however, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  sides were decent.  truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what i expected.  i didn't much enjoy the bread though.  i got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  \n\nand then the final insult.  we finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  the second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  at this point i hadn't seen our waiter in so long i assumed he actually left.  i thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  why are we ordering dessert still?  i wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  after ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  a real long time.  and after finishing what i thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  at this point our waiter returned!  we hadn't seen him since we ordered.  apparently he had been taking care of another table.  he didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult i felt by this time.  he cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  it took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  by this point we were angry.  we got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  so we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  i won't be back here when there is so much better in town. cooked to perfection. i mean perfection. red mashed potatoes were pur\u00e9ed. bacon wrapped shrimp were beyond flavorful. peppercorn steak spot on. request to sit on the patio and the fountain debuts every 15 or 30 minutes. the view is breathtaking. the wait staff is there for every need or accommodation. all high class professionals. i stopped by at prime tonight after a grueling 9 hour business meeting.  when i arrived, i was seated at a great table close to the window where i could see the bellagio fountain show in the background.  after i ordered my whiskey, i had a chance to truly appreciate the beauty of this restaurant.  the decor is very upscale, romantic and very ornate.  a great place for a power business dinner or a date.\n\nfor dinner, i ordered the butternut squash soup, bone-in rib-eye steak, potato gnocchi and their banana tart for desert.\n\nmy entire meal was amazing.  each dish was perfectly prepared and super yummy!  \nif you want a great steak dinner in one of las vegas' most romantic places, come to the prime!\n\nthe food, fountain show and sexy decor rocks!! service was incredible. thank you russell for the great suggestions and service. everything was very good. we had the peppercorn strip with house sauce, mac n cheese, and crispy salmon. highly recommend. we went to celebrate my friend's birthday last week. i'm telling you, the filet was amazing! he got the boned in rib eye, also phenomenal! we ordered the mashed potatoes as our side, not that original, i know, but it was creamy buttery deliciousness! the service was impeccable. seriously, no complaints at all. go and enjoy this gem! while i can say only excellent things about yellowtail, a fantastic restaurant also located in the bellagio, i can't unfortunately say the same for prime, this time around.\n\ni've had excellent experiences at prime before so i expected nothing different, however this time, this past wednesday, i couldn't decide what was worse, the service or the food.  maybe they were both equally bad.  my drink wasn't filled for almost 20 minutes, and i had to ask and then it took another 10 minutes for it to arrive, then i ordered another, and same story...no one asked us how our food was, the waiter was busy doing something else unfortunately and the people at the table next to us was also waiting and waiting.\n\nthe ny strip w/soy looked great, but i actually had to change knives from the first steak knife they gave me, to a different stronger one because the meat was so poorly preapred, it was tough and i barely ate 1/2 of it and then gave up.\n\nthe sea bass my buddy ordered was also over powered by the sauce it came with, another less than appetizing meal.  \n\non a positive note, yellowtail, i would highly recommend...ate there twice this trip and both times the service and food, as usual, was flawless.\n\ni hope bellagio fixes these types of issues at prime, i have had good experiences there in the past, but i don't know if i'll visit it on my next trip.", "W8-Bsk_hHg5pxbt4EhmPWQ": "spent only one night here and the main reason is because they're pet friendly. our room was the queen suite that had a stove and full size refrigerator and pullout sofa bed. check in and check out was a quick and easy process.\n\nfree continental breakfast which, according to my brother, is pretty decent and they offered good food. \n\noverall, decent and quiet place. far from the strip, which is good if you're not into partying and the vegas nightlife.", "38YPE4KCvgChy9y6FcksEQ": "the pizza wasn't very warm when it arrived (they didn't use the warming bag at time of delivery) and the order was wrong, but the pizza tasted good.", "Cg3sK4ptre1uPPCzPWH1aw": "seriously, where are the vegetarian options? all the dishes (even the salads) have either meat, fish, poultry or eggs in them. i have heard that this place is good from my friends but i can't join them since there is nothing for vegetarian or vegan people to eat here. vegetarianism is becoming more popular everyday and restaurants like this one have to learn to adapt and cater the needs and wants of people becoming vegetarians or vegans. sadly, this is one of many restaurants who fail to understand this change. there are very few places where vegetarian or vegan people can have a proper meal. i'll come here only when there is a proper vegetarian/vegan menu in place.", "J9f-9Prw2YVM-fiZqv2fmQ": "parking is tough to get here so i don't get to go much. i also get a little cautious sometimes as they frequently have multiple questionable looking characters.\n\npro's:\n- legendary fries that used to be super huge and gave you great value for your buck\n- good burgers\n- if you drink, it looks like they have a lot of different kinds of alcohol\n\ncon's:\n- customer service? hahaha. not here. if you can get more than a fart out of one of the twin's working there, you are ahead of the pack.\n- dirty, messy tables, crap everywhere.\n- many questionable characters here. someone once asked me if i wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while i was eating. i'm being totally honest too.\n- their french fry portions have gotten smaller. they used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one.\n- really expensive hot dogs. \n- they have strict limits on ketchup. no i'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.\n\ni do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and i do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out. fries are cooked to perfection....very crispy.  portions are out of this world.  don't waste your time on a small or medium, you'll regret not having more. \n\nhot dogs & burgers were very good.\n\nsecure parking is available around the corner at s bouquet st & sennott st for a few bucks. hidey ho!

amazing! if you come on a friday or saturday after 6 or 7pm, expect to have a bit of a wait. one nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you

they have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. when i went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts

the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  like the music, i can see how the pasta bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else.  for my taste buds, this was overload.  interesting yes, but i can't say i found it good.\nhere are some details:  \npasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  i prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.\nsauces - here is the in-your-face part.  the gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although i do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.\nthe le sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because i love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. i could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  and what is with the dried hunks of bread?  i could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  \nthe carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish i enjoyed most of the three.  even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.\non the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  the atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  the ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  and the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti/lasagna place.\nas a matter of taste, i'm going to have to pass on pasta bar.  for the price, i'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  if culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out. lured down the slightly  hidden path next to a typical irish dining place by the promise posed by a photo rendering the logo of

is quite personal and yet uncumbersome.  the space is plainly lit and is no bigger than a small chapel on capri, yet it is intimate and warm.  \n\nwhat i loved most is that the rumour being spread by a bartender over at amsterdams about the freshness of the food, turned out to be true and a welcome aroma to hungry souls.\n\nthe gnocci, the carbonara, the soup.  you cannot make an error ordering

from jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress clea duvall, that a few years ago epicure changed locations. to a few doors down farther east on queen, on the same side of the street. which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. it was a pleasant surprise. i didn't venture upstairs but i was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.\n\nthe menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. but for the fussy eater (i was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck/veal/lamb/chicken options. i appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! luckily jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. \n\nmy eyes went straight for the pumpkin ravioi ($14), which i was assured was \"not a mistake\". and it wasn't. i barely looked up my from my plate as i feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. they were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. the mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. the portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. good value for the money.\n\ni was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, grand marnier cheesecake or cr\u00e8me caramel, belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively stuffed. after seeing that epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night i know where i'll be heading for late night dessert! nice little spot, cozy for 2 but i gotta say i was a bit upset that they had no bitters for my fav old

other hand was real good.  i ordered a paris pizza which i never really order but thoroughly enjoyed. it even had brie which i do not like but really went well. wife had the lasagna which again was

were both taking orders and serving food, which made the service very slow. the waitress took about 10 minutes to come around to our table and forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted until i mentioned it. in addition, it took a while to get either waitress' attention when we need ed napkins or extra utensils. lastly, we had ordered the the fried ice cream with mango ice cream, however, our waitress failed to mention that they only had one flavor of ice cream. when we told her about the mistake, she just curtly explained that they only had one flavor in stock. it was just a frustrating experience.\n\noverall, the food was good, but the service lacking. i would come back to eat the crispy eggplant because it was so good. oh boy! i love veggie restaurants! especially asian influenced.  i usually try the general tzo chick'n when i try out a place for the first time. even not so good that is stomach-able ^_^. soo delicious, lunches are priced right!  my only ding would be the soup was pretty salty. i'm a fan and will come back. they have a veggie meat ball that i'm curious about. i have a sunflower at home that has a delicious ball that tastes of cinnamon and cumin. hard to find how to make so if soy and shiitake mushrooms are the real ingredients to what i have back home, then oh boy!!!\n\nok the bathrooms are single and clean for the populated traffic. staff was pleasant and checked up on us.  can't wait to see them again :) this was my first vegan meal! i went with the familiar orange chicken. it was legit. i didn't miss the chicken at all. thank you for some great lunch! i'll be back again for sure visited the veggie house today.   the atmosphere was pleasant,  the food was good.   we ordered the slightly smoked fish appetizer which we didn't care for as it was a cold dish.  i enjoyed the broccoli shrimp, however, it would have been better with a little more sauce.  i'll make sure to ask for more next time (we will definitely come back!) my spouse loved the gen'l tso chicken.   the menu is pretty extensive so a return visit is a must do! i want to live at veggie house. seriously,  how does chef kenny do it? lettuce wraps? bomb. giant bowl of miso soup? delectable. mongolian beef? the ish! and it's all meatless.  we ate soooo much but at the end of the meal we didn't have that dreaded feeling of \"the itis\" since everything is on the healthier side. everything was served so quickly,  if you're in a rush then this spot is for you. also if you like crazy delicious food that won't leave you feeling guilty then this place is also for you. don't be fooled by the fact that it's vegan and vegetarian,  the food is as good as, if not better than its meat filled counterparts.  i'm mad that i'm not eating there right now. chef kenny, i heart your face and your food. don't be scared when you see a face in the window at night, that's just me waiting for you to open.", "eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw": "awesome, awesome, awesome! food was great and potion size was more then enough. service and helpfulness was as well a pulse from jo. great place will defiantly will be going back! did i mention inexpensive as well. my husband had steak salad and raved about it. i had steak nachos which was great. we will be returning. sitting here eating my huge portion of steak nachos.  the nachos chips are crispy pita chips with seasoning.  actually pretty good.  the nachos come with certain toppings, but they don't tell you what,  and you have to pay $1.00 extra if you want something else added on.  i had to pay for rice, hummus, olives, extra garlic sauce, etc.  i was not expecting this because the place i usually go to in henderson is same price for a bowl no matter how many ingredients you add.  \nthe place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  it is chipolte style service but very crammed.  there was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time.\ni'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  they earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous.", "RvpSsArnUXRZgC4-I7AyTQ": "it is a cute little place with very friendly staff; however, i went there on three different occasions and was disappointed with the quality of the food. i tried the cheddar and broccoli quiche which was terribly bland (no salt and pepper or nutmeg, no noticeable cheese or broccoli flavor, just bland egg and dough). another time i had the grilled cheese sandwich - same problem, bland and greasy. if they improved their food, it would be perfect. this shop combines coffee, breakfast and coffee break items and a yarn shop (which made my wife happy). during a recent visit we enjoyed well made asparagus and ham quiches with well dressed side greens. there were three regular and one decaf offerings from two area roasters. service was friendly and helpful.", "u_vPjx925UPEG9DFOAAvFQ": "the photos posted of the rooms are definitely not indicative of the room i stayed in except for the one of the broken electrical socket.  the plug for the tub didn't fit properly hence i couldn't take a bath, the electrical socket was broken and didn't seem to even work enough to charge my cell phone or the portable charger, there was bird poop all over the window of my room, there was food sitting outside the rooms next to mine from room service for the entire time i was there, and the breakfast buffet was bad.  the lettuce in the salad bar was wilted, the scrambled eggs were runny, the \"soup of the day\" wasn't labeled. it may have well been mystery soup as it had a creamy base but with random spinach like veggies and tasted a bit over salted. for the over all price i payed for both the room(almost $200 for a monday til tuesday, 1 day stay), i could have stayed at a better kept or newer casino.  the last time i stayed at the flamingo was probably about 15yrs ago and it was better kept back then than it was now...maybe they spent all the gambling revenues towards the birds and fishes in the courtyard as there were only flamingos there the last time i stayed there. we got a go room which was nice but 2 stars off for:\n\n1. our toilet overflowed at 3am\n2. no late check-out, not even at noon!\n\ni was looking forward to the bed since everyone raved that you couldn't get out of it but for me, i got out of it with no hesitation. my bed at home is waaaaaay better.\n\ni did enjoy the built-in tv in the mirror in the bathroom. my bf thought i fell in the toilet because i was taking so damn long but i just had to reassure him that i was just watching tv lol! and i didn't mind the pink florenscent lighting in the bathroom. pink is my favorite color!\n\nsure the casino floor can be smoky but i really didn't care because as a smoker, i was contributing to the smokiness.\n\nand boo to the cocktail waitress that wouldn't give my bf 2 drinks because she was insinuating that one was for me and i wasn't playing at the time. um, missy can't you see that i have 2 drinks already that are keeping me rather busy?\n\nthe pool is the highlight of the whole place. so much fun!!! the slides connecting to the pools were great and the turn around of people was pretty good so you will find a lounge chair. sure there were kids but not as much as i expected. and they were about 12+ years old and watching them have a blast made me feel like acting 12 years old again and go down the slide over and over and over and over again. the waterfall is nice too.\n\nand how lucky was i when i lost my dl in the pool and one of the lifegaurds was able to spot me out and give it back to me! lifegaurd you rock!!!!!\n\n2 for 1 dos equis at the pool bar! drunk swimming! hell yeah! go here every time we are in vegas, clean and well kept, staff is always ontop of things, only thing missing is they could use a few better restaurants, beds are great i was surprised with how they redid the og rooms. granite and marble countertops throughout, even in the shower, highly recommend the upgrade if you can. we had a view of the wheel. right outside of the hotel is a strip that has awesome food and bars, a daiquiri place literally right outside. there is also a few liquor stores that surround the hotel if y'all want to save money and make your own drinks. i don't think we paid more than 30 for uber there from the airport. and even though the lines look long at the counter desk to check in, they move fast. if you go to the pool, opened from 9-5 by the way, seats are very limited and the drinks start at 17 and 42 for a pitcher; it is cheaper to get the pitcher and splitting it with people. so i put off writing this review for a couple months because i was kind of pissed. i want to be fair. we will start with the good stuff.\nwe stayed here back in june 2017. we, my husband and i, were going to las vegas for combination of honeymoon and my husbands 40th birthday. we invited some friends to join us. we ended up with about 20 of us there. we didnt all stay at the flamingo. only 6 of us did. others stayed in time shares and other hotels. we are platinum members so we got to skip the long line, that was great. we chose the flamingo because it was iconic. we knew it was a bit older and less expensive so we really were prepared for less fancy than other places. we were ok with that. good thing too since our mini suite was quite run down and not very clean. housekeeping obviously needs some training. but we didnt really mind. we had the birthday party at carlos and charlies with all 20 of us. it was great and our waiter , jason, was the best. we rented a cabana at the go pool which was pretty nice but the mister in the cabana didnt work and just dripped water all over our stuff. between my husband and i and the rest of our party we spent many thousands of dollars. we had saved so we could do anything and everything we wanted and we did. it was great. at the point of getting our bags out of the room and heading down to check out i probably would have given them 4 stars. quite pleased with the experience to this point....\nand that was the point where we discovered that the staff at the flamingo did not want us to have happy memories. at the check out kiosk we discovered a charge of just over a thousand dollars that we didnt understand. we went to the front desk and were told that someone in housekeeping had gone into our room and noticed sleeping bags and enough luggage for about 6 extra people. -first of all, our do not disturb sign was up the entire time so no one was supposed to go in there at all.-  i told her that was a lie and we wouldnt pay it. she went in the back to talk to a manager and came out with out the manager and with no solution. she called housekeeping and was told the supervisor was not available but that they had pictures to prove it. i asked to see the pictures. they never could supply them. we had to leave to catch a plane but didnt pay. we had agreed with the front desk lady that it would be left as pending until the problem was resolved. after weeks of calling and getting no returned phone calls. total run around. they never supplied us with pictures. it was a horrible experience. we found out we could contact ceasars customer service so we did. they did call us back and said the charge had been removed. no sorry, no admitting they had made a mistake. it was more like just take it off to get us to shut up. so we dropped it because the charge was removed but never made happy. we will stay at ceasars properties but never at the flamingo again.\ni hope  it was worth it for you -flamingo- to try to screw us out of $1000 because i can promise that no one in our 20 person party, many of which are las vegas regulars, or anyone any of us ever talk to about it will stay at your hotel. ceasars is lucky that we love their other properties so much, especially paris. i grew up going to this hotel and wanted to try and start the same tradition with my family and son.  boy oh boy has this hotel gone downhill....was so disappointed.  there were many problems:\n\n1.) check in took 2 effing hours, we didn't get into our room until 2 am\n2.) be careful, you don't want to sleep on the side where the cromwell hotel is...their rooftop club will keep you up all night long :(\n3.) this hotel is no longer family friendly, it's more fitted for 21 year olds.\n4.)  was super sad about their new go pool crap, use to be open to all guests, now only 21 and over and more of a club now with super loud, annoying music\n5.)  families are now asked to be shoved into their tiny beach club pool, so ridiculous and insulting for families.\n6.) do not try to be in the lobby when the party pool closes at 7 pm...drunk people everywhere\n7.) the rooms are renovated,  but so ugly and they did a really bad job\n8.) elevators are scary\n9.) the buffet used to be amazing...it's terrible now\n\ni was very disappointed and sad that we will no longer be carrying on the family tradition at this hotel...can't believe i wasted money there.  i wouldn't even stay here if it was just my friends and i, terrible.  so mad my son had to endure this icky hotel. stayed here again june 21-24. elevators are fixed. most rooms updated. i really like this hotel :) do not settle! keep searching! waste of money!\n\nthis hotel was not what i expected for a las vegas property in the center of the strip. do not be fooled by the lobby, the rest of the hotel is old and outdated?\n\nhallways smell, scuffs and dirt marks on the doors, directional signs missing from the wall, moulding was breaking off. inside the room, outlets barely work, furniture was chipped, my dresser was missing a top drawer, vents clogged with dirt. there are about 15 elevators and only about 5 were working! the pool is nice....but all vegas hotel pools are nice.\n\nas much money as they make daily; there is no reason this hotel should look like it did. i will not stay there again. keep searching for place to stay. i've stayed at super 8's that were better than the flamingo! meh.\n-very centrally located on the strip, makes walking easier.\n-somewhat dated.\n-parking garage is absolutely disgusting, although it is free.\n-rooms are just ok.\n-adjacent to the linq which is a nice new property.\n-strip view rooms do indeed have a great view.\n-the live flamingos are cool.\ni probably would choose a newer & nicer  place if given an option but i would not rule the flamingo out. the flamingo is one of the older casinos but it is right on the strip the pool was nice the staff was friendly. the room was fine it showed s little wear and tear.\nwhat they need to improve \ncheck in was a nightmare almost 2 hours of waiting in line that is not good customer service. the parking lot is a joke they share a building with hertz and valet so not much space left we parked on the roof #7 the elevator stops on #6 so u need lug your stuff down the stairs. but it is right in the middle of strip so the location is the major plus. we walked or rode the bus (8$all day) poker room is awesome!\n\n$1 and $2 limit\nand $2 and $4 limit\nas well as the no limit tables of course\n\ntip your waitress and they will keep coming is all i can say. my husband and i were tipping $3 for 2 drinks and she said she was letting the bartender know to make them good for these nice people\n\nbe kind and you will have a blast in vegas\nloved our room and for $35 can't beat the location, free parking, nice room, great restaurants we really had a good week here recently! we arrived in town early on a sunday, checked in (surprisingly short line!), but rooms were not ready yet as they had had a busy weekend. no problem, we checked our luggage and went to get something to eat. we checked back in at the desk and were given our rooms (we always upgrade to go rooms), and shortly after that our luggage was brought up to us! the staff was very friendly and helpful. our rooms were very nice, cleaned daily and always while we were out. i loved our view, best we've ever had in countless trips to vegas. the bed was very comfy. we even had a fridge in our room! there are plenty of elevators in this hotel and you can use different ones to get quicker access to different parts of the hotel/casino. we loved meeting for breakfast on the patio in the gardens where we would sit with a muffin and coffee and plan our day. the pool was nice too. we did not get a car due to traveling with a group this time so it was nice to be so centrally located with access to everything we wanted to do. we tried the new carlos n charlies' restaurant and it was good. we also like the food court, very handy with plenty of options. our only complaint was with the restaurant, while the food & service were pretty good the problem was when it was time to leave we had to wait in a long line to pay our bill! they could have used a few more staff people to expedite this process. their standard excuse for everything.....we are undergoing renovation.  when it comes to having no working light switch in your room and the over head towel bar falling on your head in the shower that is no excuse.  these rooms should not even be rented out.   (especially at $100 and $190 a night) in addition, there was no available hotel parking for hotel guests (not even valet parking) and the bell hop that was supposed to help us with our luggage (before driving the car  to ballys to park) never showed up.  try asking to speak to a hotel manager......after 10 minutes they are still on the phone (probably avoiding speaking to angry hotel guests). let me start off by saying that i've been coming to vegas for 20 plus years. i've stayed in many hotels and i've had horrible experiences in most of them... this time i   reluctantly decided to stay at the flamingo. it's the oldest hotel in the area so it can't be as \"good\" as the others, right? wrong. by far the best hotel i've stayed at in vegas. where trump had wonderful rooms but no casino, flamingo came in with a wonderful room and a casino. where treasure island had horrible service and crappy rooms, flamingo came in with wonderful customer service and a wonderful room. my room was clean, comfortable and neat. every person working there greeted me with a smile. and the biggest plus of all? the flamingo let me bring my dog and let me walk her anywhere except for the casino and pool area. plus, plus, and plus. from now on every time i visit vegas i will only stay at the flamingo. screw the rest of these modernized barf hotels. stay where the real las vegas history remains....  thank you flamingo ........and margaritaville (for the massive hangover)... ;) the hotel is just average, but i give a good review based solely upon the pool. the pool area is very large, and they have an adult only pool. the dj at this pool was pretty cool. also the servers were very attentive, and their drinks and daybeds were very affordable. the vibe at the pool was awesome.\n\nthe rooms here have been updated, but the bathroom seemed old. this hotel has a great location, pretty much the center of the strip. after coming to vegas for five times now, flamingo hotel has the worse customer service i've ever seen. after multiple calls for service request because our shower wouldn't work, they lied and said that they did not have any other room available so we would have to wait for engineer to come to fix the shower (when? who knows). no one ever came to fix the shower and they finally switched us to a different room (no room available, huh?) they do not care whether you are unhappy with your stay or not. a girl named teddy is extremely rude and should not be working in customer service. also, the manager here could care less if u complain. so please don't waste your vacation and find a better hotel to stay at. they do not even deserve one star. please save yourself a headache and do not stay here.", "zOMiDo5iGn5dTrckP4F_Ig": "honestly i expected a lot more from this restaurant due to rave reviews of the others in the area. i ordered a burrito with steak and the quinoa brown rice. it was obvious the steak wasn't super fresh; it was kind of cold. the burrito, although super large, didn't have too much flavor and the quinoa brown rice was pretty unappetizing. the dining area was pretty dirty too, tables had food all over them and hadn't been cleaned for a while. i would  give this another try and order something different but until then the 2 stars stands.", "XhUec_6-kgPy1_ZYUrzvPQ": "my wife and i went there last night to celebrate my birthday. it was our first time there so we were very excited to try another dining spot at the m resort. we arrived at our reservation time and the hostess was very nice and polite and showed us to our table which

or dining, it's only for the reservation & host/management experience.  in short, making a reservation means nothing!  i reserved a table for 4 on saturday night at 7:15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the m resort & casino.  it was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. i asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  so we went to a casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  they weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. seriously?!  so i asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.  well, they never called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the burger & brews place next door.\n\n\nclearly, anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations.... obviously an opentable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table.  we were super let down because the menu looks great, but i can't comment on that.", "WBlYp-nmLiBLp7VjP1FJFg": "high price, low quality and bad

enough food to feed 3 people. so that was disappointing. the sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked/rubbery. the stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth

we've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  this is a unit which holds 5-tons of puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  we spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  it's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  it had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  so, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it again.  however, before he did, all of a sudden, i heard the loudest boom!  i mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  then, it had this awful constant noise - like i've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and i didn't know what was going on and i panicked because i wasn't sure if it was smoke or puron or what so i ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  my roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  the compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  he tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  so, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but i may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  the electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (lol), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.  this electrician made a point of including some of this on the invoice and gave us the contact information of his friend in case we needed additional assistance with this matter.  thank god for him and for yelp and all the yelpers out there who recommended him. :)

afternoon of drinking in the sun. our waitress was also lovely and attentive. hubby's salad was ok. \n\nminus: bland, flavourless food. my rice seemed like they it had been sitting under a lamp, very dried out, and the beans were basically kindergarten paste. not worth the money. food was pretty good.  my wife's margarita was too sweet for me (it was the coconut one).  my margarita was very good (not really worth the cost, but this is a touristy place).  got the tequila \"flight\" which was 3-shots, one of each style of tequila and it was very good and a pretty good price for 3 shots of alcohol.  i probably don't need to return, but it's worth a first-time visit. i'll give this place one star for the music, i would never eat or drink here again, ever. we went in for the 2 for 1 margaritas, which ended up being $11.00 each, even with the 2-fer!! yeah, the server said they were regularly 22 bucks each. they came in small plastic cups for a nice touch, they weren't bad but the food was horrible. we ordered tons of starters and everything was bla, dry, even the nachos went back!  i went the safe route and got the street style tacos and i'll tell you any taco truck in california is 100 times better than that dry, bland, chopped up fajita meat thrown on some greasy corn tortillas and then topped with raw chopped onions and some cilantro, i ate half of one and gave the rest all back. ew. actually one of my friends said she probably wouldn't eat mexican food for a while, that's how bad it was. \noh, and the cute bar girl poured tequila all over my face and  neck when i went up for the \"mas tequila\" shot at the bar. seriously.. stayed outside by the strip and people-watched. guessing where everyone is from and if it's their first  right time in vegas is relaxing and entertaining somehow. had a few drinks right under the heater, it was pretty chilly outside. they have different options for food, mexican style mostly, nice loud music and all kinds of characters. great spot to watch the bellagio water show. i usually give companys a break but i truly think this company needs great improvement,  the service as far as how long it took to get a burger was very poor it took 25 to 35 minutes  after the initial 15 minutes it took just to get our server to the table to receive our food the food was ok but not really very good, my friends said they had mexican food and it was definitely better it hot on the patio no misters . i'm surprise this place stays open, i assume it does good business since it's conveniently located on the strip.\n\ntake my advice and save yourself and eat somewhere else.\n\n-they charged ridiculous prices for mexican food. expect $10-15 per person for a small plate. i order the 2 combo with rice, beans, chicken soft taco and tamale. it was not filling, and definitely not tasty. \n-chips and salsa was below par. \n-the guacamole was $10!!! for a small serving. the waitress did not bother telling us how much it was. \n-incompetent workers. seriously, how hard is it get hot water? first time, you brought out cold water. we asked for hot water.\n-don't bother asking for suggestions, their not at all familiar with their menu! great all around. the tortilla soup was fabulous and the service from everyone was awesome! the only reason for 4 stars was nothing really blew me away. it's a chain. tastes like chain. server was friendly. prices were reasonable if you go in knowing what you're gonna get. love the check in rita ( which was stronger than the specialty drink i had). try to get a seat by the ledge so you can people watch. we went after dark whole folks were heading to the clubs and that was the best entertainment of the night! the band was amazing! great cover songs and crowd interaction.\nthe queso was mediocre (and you have to pay for chips and salsa).\nthe portobello mushroom fajitas were fantastic!\ncocaritas had a great taste, but lacking in booze.\nthe service was

already eaten the meat given to me before the guy had even left the table.  i often had to wait 5-10 minutes between 'bites' as they were very busy.\n\nthe meat was either extremely overcooked or border line raw (i like rare, this was nearly blue).  as i'm from texas, i've eaten a substantial amount of cornbread and i can honestly say this was sugar with food colouring and a tea spoon of

checked to see if there was anything we wanted more of.\n\nlive music was a nice treat.\n\nwe were reminded two hours after arriving that it was time to leave due to the time limit. this place has ruined  my view of all other brazilian restaurants that i thought where amazing. where do i begin the all you can eat food, i'm about to burst as i write this. all i can say for the food is i made one trip to the galleria, after that i was at the table. why? the frequency of the carvers bringing meat to my table was ridiculously fast,how fast? as i was finishing my meat and trying to eat my side dish  i was being offered more meat. i literally never had an empty plate from the time i sat down until i finally tapped out to sit and enjoy my drink and the entertainment. the entertainment is one of the things about this restaurant that will make others seem bland. from the guitarist, to the capoeira fighters this place is an over all experience, and one i won't soon forget. stacks on stacks of meat, and some super yummy pineapple! \n\ni think at one point, i was playing catch up with all the cuts of meat i had waiting for me on my plate. all of us couldn't help being a little extra gluttonous. \n\nand who can say no to their pineapple? \nthe second time they came around with the pineapple, to my group of 6, and we were told there were only 3 pieces left at the moment... every

were full and couldn't accommodate - there were multiple empty tables (that seated 6). yet, we were told to wait, as the server continued to seat others who came after us with later reservations of 9:30. \nit wasn't until we had to press them for our reservation a 3rd time, where we finally got seated - in the corner of the restaurant beside the bar. not impressed. not to mention there were still empty tables in the main dining. \n\nquality-wise for the food was much better, in comparison to their adelaide location. salad bar/antipasto at this location was much smaller and bleak, but the

of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below.\nthe khinkali reminds me of chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what i'm used to. it was creamy and dark. each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. it definitely needed something to cut the heaviness.\nwhile waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, georgian, spicy). the sauces and the pickled cabbage all have tastes i am not familiar with. i ate it all because the food was taking so long to come. the pickled cabbage i did not like so much.\nall in all, the service was good, the food was filling and i was satisfied. i came here based on the great reviews on yelp. i have never

khinkali (georgian dumplings). there were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. let me say upon arrival of our food i was shocked by how generous the portions were! the khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. and the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. we both loved the food. the khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. i needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. their sauces are really tasty btw. they come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.\n\nthe food was so memorable! i would love to come back to try some

the thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. it's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. this dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. i love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. they both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. \n\nother great dishes are the chicken lo mein, general tso's chicken, and chicken with broccoli.\n\nplus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. no need for takeout!", "oS96aJIHFWcFAlGHKKXjaw": "so happy to have found a little piece of france in pittsburgh! as a francophile and food-lover, i was excited to try this place out. it exceeded my expectations. the little shop mirrored the boulangeries in france. i ate the sandwich la campagnard, which was a simple turkey sandwich on a baguette. its simplicity, freshness, and texture made for an amazing gastronomic experience. i also sampled the pistachio macaron which was reasonably priced and very good as well. of course, i had to get a baguette tradition, which had an intoxicating smell and had the perfect consistency of crunchy and fluffy on the inside. \nwill definitely go back soon, and i suggest anyone who is visiting pittsburgh must go here. \nthe only downside was that there were only a couple of tables, and with the line forming into the street, not everyone could sit. luckily, there is a park across the street. wow!!!!\n \ni have never walked into a bakery that smelled this good.\nthat is the first impression. the pastries are unique: not dried out, crusty pretty pieces. fresh, flavorful, not-too-sweet... just the right touch of flavor to leave a vibrant aftertaste. only a few variations. that is because everything is fresh, made from scratch. no commercial mixes here. \ni really can't pick a favorite item, but the small loaves of bread are really special. large enough for two. no leftovers. \nif you have ever been to a bakery with dozens of different cookies, pastries and cakes... this is not that kind of bakery. \nbetter than i have tasted in germany, france , denmark or switzerland. fresher. \nremember the word fresh. it defines la gourmandine.\ni wanted to add photos... but, sorry, i ate everything! finally tried this bakery which has been on my list for quite some time during the lawrenceville cookie tour.\n\ni'm giving it 4 vs. 5 stars because with all the hype and praise, i thought it would have more selections.  it's a rather small bakery with a small selection.  mind you, what they do have and what i tried was very good; i was just expecting more.\n\ni had a chocolate \u00e9clair and some almond concoction.  both were excellent.\n\nstaff is

food to die for. very cool, spacious dining room decked out in black and red. friendly servers, although a little slow. delicious food - the chips are fresh and warm, and the three different salsas are all amazing; the grilled peach salad was more like canned peach salad, but still was light, tasty, and refreshing on a hot summer day; and the jumbo grilled burrito...wow! there are so many good authentic mexican places in this area, but this burrito would probably top them all! the passion fruit slaw and masa-thing on the side were equally wonderful...so much flavor! like its siblings fez

wonderful ladies...shout out to dottsy z!..hit up happy hour on a beautiful wednesday evening. only happy hour turned into happy hours! \n\nthings i loved: \n*the over all vibe and styling of the place. great decor and great hint of spanish flair without over doing it. \n*the food was excellent. i had some chips and salsa which were pretty standard. the tacos, although, were outstanding. i had one chicken and one beef. the beef was awesome! i am trying to eat red meat only two times per week and i may just have to have both meals be these tacos! \n*the service was great as well. i've heard people say this place is \"gay friendly\". this day and age, \"friendly\" anything is wonderful. but seriously, our server/bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt. \n\ni can't wait to

forgot, or they just don't truely flame it, so was kind of disappointed.  the fried meatballs which were divine.  and the yellowtail hamachi melted in my mouth. \n\nthe drinks were very tasty as well, they had a granny smith apple cocktail that could be dangerous, as you couldn't taste the alcohol in it, so we ordered two. ;)\n\nin all, loved this place, will definately go back again. i'm just going to say what needs to be said- soul is the best restaurant in charlotte. they made a mean dirty martini and the pork belly tacos are ridiculously addictive. i think the fact that i'm willing to wait well over an hour  to be seated (which is usually way beyond my waiting threshold), says something about how amazing this place is. go and you won't be disappointed! why don't more people hang out here? i'm yelping as i'm sitting by the dj booth. love the vibe, the music, but i wish at least few folks would groove on the \"dance floor\". this is a really good soul spot if you just want to do a couple of two steps and do a few spins. i will for sure be back. a friend took me here for my birthday. seating is first come/first serve. upon arrival, i gave hostess my phone number and they would text me as soon as a table became available. watched people come and go. an hour later and we still hadn't been seated. when i inquired about how much longer it would be, turns out the hostess wrote down the wrong number. we were seated immediately after that, but it took a while for waiter to bring drinks and take order. as far as food selection, menu is unique in offerings. i went with the pita chips and tzatziki dip, fried goat cheese on bruschetta, and mini burgers. server did not check in with us often and forgot my burger order. i finally got it and manager apologized, but due to lack of attention i passed on ordering the sushi as we had already been there a long time. we also got free drinks because of the inconvenience. even with the poor service, the food was absolutely delicious and i would be willing to give it another try. pork belly tacos. amazing! you have to get them - probably my favorite food in charlotte dropped in for a late night dinner and some drinks and the place was packed but we didn't have to wait longer than a beer by the bar before being able to sit and order some grub.  we went with sushi since is was such a warm night and neither of us was could commit to downing anything that warmer than the weather.  between the two of us we got the vegetable roll, ki roll, spicy tuna roll, and salmon nigiri.  the rolls came out fast and disappeared equally as quickly.  they were delicious!  fresh and wonderful.  between the food, frosty beverages, and awesome tunes the dj was spinning i left feeling full, tipsy, refreshed, and completely satisfied! this is a great place for a friday night with the ladies or a romantic date night. get the pork belly watermelon tacos and your life will change as you know it. the brussels sprouts are good too. the rest of the food was ok. this place is tiny, so the wait will probably be long. we waited 2.5 hours on a friday night, but we just hopped over to peculiar rabbit next door and had drinks at the bar while we waited. they had a dj and it felt very metropolitan.", "DXTwwxAtxw_KV1sQjKCQJQ": "i always bring my jewelry and rosaries in for repair here and they are the best!! sal and forrest

awesome hawaiian food traditionally made and not so pricey either! the food is consistently very yummy.  love all their selection.  i like how they mix hawaiian and korean food together...fusion huge portion but nothing special.  we had the galbi chicken june meat combo that many people raved about.  chicken was too sweet.  june meat is boring.  the galbi, however, was very good. i've been coming to this place since the very beginning. the first time i was here years ago not long after their opening, russell offered us soup without charge, and was so friendly and welcoming. i've come here for lunches, dinners, and pick-ups. i've had their korean, chinese and hawaiian dishes and none has disappointed. one of my favorites is definitely the jajangmyun (wheat noodles in black bean sauce). the portion is huge and i usually eat about half and take the rest to go. i especially like to order pick-up from here because the food has always been quick and ready for me when i arrive. the service could be a bit slow and at times it's hard to get the servers' attention, but the place is usually pretty busy. this is definitely one of my go-to places for korean/hawaiian food, and one of the best in town.", "oUX2bYbqjqST-urKbOHG6w": "a cafe with a very chill and relaxed ambience. the menu has a good variety, and out of the six drinks we tried, we weren't disappointed. we tried a mango smoothie, banana frozen latti, matcha latti, caramel latti, and from their signature teas: emerald and scarlett. we also tried the raindrop dessert and it's unique and something to definitely try, but maybe only once. the prices are very reasonable and i'm excited to try more!

we had the chorizo and black bean queso - seriously, possibly the best appetizer i have ever had. we both ordered rather eccentric sounding main dishes. i actually was presented a different meal than i had asked for, but when i tried it, it didn't matter! everything about this place is great - the indoor seating area is small but great furniture and chandelier gallery. the outdoor area is nice too. staff friendly and timely. definitely coming back again. mole sauce was amazing! chicken was a little dry, but searously the mole sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon.\nskip the fundido.  the waiter could not explain some of the items on the menu, which was funny. the hicima tostado was great!

after a couple of bites of sushi i had to stop and toss it --- the rolls tasted like funky fish! i called akahana and spoke with the manager who gave me the soy sauce, and while he offered to make some new sushi for me, i didn't take him up on it. i also didn't ask for a refund. i did however ask him to visit his kitchen and investigate why my two different sushi rolls shared the same fishy taste and smell. i suspected it was the rice or the nori, but who knows. i'm sad to say it because i love supporting plaza midwood businesses, but i will be taking a break from this spot for a while. i hope things improve. i love this place!! delicious food also at a fantastic price. you can't ask for much more than that. service is always good too. you have to try the spicy edamame and the spicy spider roll!!! can't go there without getting both. highly recommend. unless you're looking for fancy...which, i'm not.", "6nxVZ1s0mRhyRAdRymYAsQ": "poor service, been waiting for my check for 30min!

you wouldn't think it was the nice just by looking at the outside but the inside decor is wonderful. the venison was perfectly cooked and the sauces were incredible it comes with the house rice which was also great. the veal marsala was a little too saucey for my taste but still really good. the dessert options are also great. overall amazing place ! before deciding to make a long overdue trip to white oaks, i was under the impression i was making a mercy mission to save this prohibition era speakeasy given the probable dominance by crocker park and sprawl to avon lake.  boy was i mistaken.  the parking lot was jammed and therefore forced to eat in the lounge without a reservation.  in the end, probably a better choice.  the lounge, though seperate, actually shares the main dining room's huge picture window view of the heavily forested ravine and cahoon creek.  the rustic decorating and dark tones with a glowing fireplace makes you think you might be in a roaring 20's hideaway.  the bartender was a pro - courteous, efficient, \"healthy\" drink pourer.  the lounge menu struck us as pricey at first but fears were quelled when our neighbor's order arrived.  we opted for the steak sandwiches which came with potato or salad. prepared perfectly and just enough to satisfy. we felt very good about our choices all around.  i was taken by the sheer number of people and traffic when compared to the prices, cleveland economy and aforementioned new options.  it looks like white oaks has not changed, serving excellent food and taking caring of its customers.  definitely worth a re-review upon eating in the main dining room.", "i066yR2IDP4FWt6p-k9aFg": "i really need to try some other sandwiches that they offer but the paul reuben's is insanely good!!! gotta have it on the dutch crunch bread. great service!! friendly staff! the vegan selection of sandwiches is great! i got the meatless mike, vegan style, with creole onion kettle chips. it was so delicious!! i just wish they had a larger selection of healthy natural beverages but i settled for the country time lemonade. next time i will just bring my own drink but i would definitely visit again! great place! when i saw ike's had opened up in mesa, i couldn't believe it. did my beloved sandwich shop from san francisco that's always a must-visit actually makes it way to mesa? once i verified that this was the real-deal ike's, i started texting friends and family who share my love of ike's with the good news.\n\ni must confess that i haven't been to this location yet, but it's only because it's so close to my husband's work so he picks up our order. my guy says this is the best gluten free bread he's ever had. he almost sent back his sandwich the first time he ordered it because he thought they put it on regular bread. he's also a fan of the vegan cheese and dirty sauce since dairy doesn't agree with him either.\n\nbeing a vegetarian, ike's is like heaven to me. whenever there is more than two veggie options on a menu, i start to seize up with indecision (in the best way possible). their fake breaded chicken is so good. it reminds me of the patty used in mcdonald's spicy chicken sandwich (again, in the best way possible). the vegan bacon isn't as gross as it sounds although the fake fat stripes are silly looking. i added it to the reading rainbow, and it was delicious. not sure why all of the 5 star ratings. food was just average at best and with price considered it's less then average. fries were meeh, sandwiches the same and service slow. the only saving grace was the pleasant young man who took the order was both knowledgable and courteous. too much money and slow delivery, not a good combination.\n\nremoved from my bookmarks, won't be going back. fantastic sandwiches, especially if you go with the legendary dutch crunch bread. they also have authentic sf sourdough which is very good. sandwiches are huge, though quite pricey. service can be a bit slow if there's anyone in line ahead of you. be aware that all sandwiches are hot \"unless otherwise noted\". found out the hard way when ordering a ham & swiss by phone that i wanted cold - wasn't asked which way i wanted it, so hot it was. also had more stuff on it than i asked for. still quite tasty though. hell yes! i love this place. first tried it in sf and was ecstatic to learn they were opening a location in mesa (and very soon in tempe!) the menu is giant! look online before you go. i get the barry b, my gf likes the spiffy tiffy. don't skip the dirty sauce and although they're famous for the dutch crunch bread, i opt for the sourdough because it's phenomenal.\n\nfries are great, onion rings tasted great but i made the mistake of taking them home and they ended up a bit soggy. obviously not their fault but just a warning to those who want to take out onion rings.\n\ni can't tell if they moved i to a struggling shopping center or if all the restaurants around them closed because ike's is so awesome.\n\ni have been here 4 times now and will continue to drive 15 minutes for my new favorite sandwich shop!", "Hb8pO9jpr4IeB6cFcVZxxA": "new owners have really given this place a facelift!

it was a house specialty and lives up to its name. it tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. i had to order another one. then i tried the barbeque pizza, i liked it but it wasn't my favorite. it was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. it just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. the prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when i go again i probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  the peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and i crave these every day it was amazing! than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than i did so it depends on your taste but i probably will try something else. \nthe most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. fresh fries galore. the most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. i think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. i didn't expect that and i think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  the calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. \ni enjoyed joes farm grill and i plan on visiting again. i think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. i feel better knowing i'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. i hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. this restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want. holy smokes!  i can see driving to gilbert, az from ventura county just to re-experience this delightful dining experience.  flavor, flavor, flavor!  on our way back from our new orleans road trip we detoured and took a chance on joe's and it was well worth it.    we are bringing the kids next time so watch out!  by the way the g.i joe's showcased were a nice touch. going a little down hill. place is getting dated and becoming less clean. the food is still good but it's a little more expensive than it's worth. not always quick service. i'm sure with a little work this place can be just as awesome as it use to be, but right now i will pass it up. a great local place. good food. good atmosphere. healthy. only draw back is they are busy all the time. good things are worth waiting for! tough menu.  a lot of choices, so i was vacillating a lot.  i finally decided on the ahi tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries.  i also ordered the beet salad just to try it.  i liked everything.  including the onion rings the hubbie ordered.  this would be the place i would go for onion rings.  very tasty.\n\nwe sat outside. not sure if it would be enjoyable in summer, but mid-feb, with it finally hitting the upper 70s, it was wonderful.  several people were there w/ dogs because it is really a picnic area.\n\nwe will go back.  i want to try the ahi salad...maybe stick w/ the ahi sandwich.  i think it will be the way to go when i'm craving a burger.\n\nw/o a doubt, if you go, you have to check out the bathrooms. fun place to get together with large groups. the food is always great. they offer a generous $10 credit on your birthday. my favorite is the fontina burger. great food! everything taste fresh and delicious.  it is a bit pricey but our family loves it. the outdoor area is great and kids love it because they can run around and play! sweet potatoe fries are amazing! fontina burger is where it's at. the bbq chicken salad is pretty tasty as well. it's a great family place but is also an easy and quick date night for young couples. my boyfriend and i have been here a couple of times together and it's always consistent and delicious!

(two of my favorites). one of our friends ended the night by getting the birthday boy a chocolate elvis...which is ice cream, bananas, peanut butter and whipped cream.\nwindsor is awesome! a great new addition to the demarco family of ventures.  this was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points.  nonetheless, it is a terrific spot.  the structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor.  the bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space.  the patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates.  we tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters.  the double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though i almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful.  the mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though i might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it.  the wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles.  again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges.  in any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good! the fish sandwich is amazing!  great cocktails and a good beer selection. my dear love and i arrived just as the sun was going down for a quick bite after the arizona state fair. i was prepared to be frightened and off put by a to young too hip crowd but i was more than pleasantly surprised. windsor is a delightful venue, comfortable and spacious and pretty with an interesting menu. we had a specialty cocktail featuring orange water, rum and marmalade and it was de-lish-es.  we also had a nice brown pag chicken sandwich and a side of mac and cheese which is almost always too ironic for me but it was very tasty. all in all an excellent experience. parking was a hassle and an annoyance-valet parking is probably the only bad thing that the owners of this place inflict on the customers (here and at the other stores they own). that said, despite the parking annoyance we will be back. i enjoyed the entire experience and my dear love was very happy. just remember no day but today. so. good. \n\ni ordered the fish \"banh mi\" and... it was so freakin' good. whilst i do wish it was in a more traditional banh mi style bread (baguette vs round bun), it had the perfect amount of heat and i totally dug the interpretation. and the kale salad? o.m.gooooooodness. i know the mac and cheese is good and all... but you have to get the kale salad. it is green perfection. and so good for your eyes!\n\nthe husband had the burger which was.... uhm, possibly the best burger i've had in arizona??? yeah. it was like that. juicy and perfectly cooked. with a side of church potatoes - what what???? that was like the ultimate comfort food meal right there. ultimate. it was delectable. \n\nbro got the porkwich... that much pig on a piece of bread honestly scares me... but it really truly worked. and i understood why people are fanatical about it. his side of mac and cheese? now that, my friends is a good m&c. it was cheeeeeeeeesy up the heezy, and no weird liquidy sauce, the pasta shape didn't put me off. i wanted to swim in that mac and cheese. ok, maybe not because that was a hottttt little dish, but... i really really really really loved it. and wanted to steal it and eat it all. now that i'm revisiting that experience, i dunno how i feel about that kale salad. i'm torn. i choose both.\n\nmy dad had the reuben, which to me is a man-which. it was decent, just not my flava. \nmy mom had either the brown bag chicken or the grilled chicken. i don't remember because my bro's gf had the other one. they were both good and i am not a big chicken sandwich fan. perhaps not phenomenal, but i would venture to say i might at some point be persuaded to order a chicken sandwich from here. \n\nwe had the deviled egg dip... the chips were good, but the dip was kinda forgettable. \nservice was amazing, the ambiance and decor... impeccable. \n\nthere are a lot of new pretentious phx area eateries that are similar to this one... all in all, windsor is at the top.\n\nvalet is free... or you can park on the street a little further past the restaurant.", "Pe9kznAqPNFOZ6Ly1qmE0A": "after an evening dining at commercial center we decided to drive around the parking lot to see what other odd places we could find. cue club is large inside and out. like how can they use this much space? the bartender gave us the lowdown as soon as we walked in: the building is divided into smoking and non smoking and each have either quarter tables or pay by the hour tables. apparently you can only do pay by the hour if you're a pro. we chose the non smoking side and there were 2-3 other tables being used at the time. the jukebox was surprisingly really good until someone chose to play their own tunes. we did end up smelling like cigarette smoke afterwards. not sure if this is from hanging out in the smoking area initially or if it's so overpowering that it gets into the non smoking area. they also have shuffleboard and a few carnival style games like skee ball. knowing that most any billiards hall in vegas is going to be equally smoky i think i'd rather come here and know your chances

paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  the prices are obscene first of all - about double what i've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at guy savoy we had tackled two nights prior was much more affordable and more enjoyable.\n\nour standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  the next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  the truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  i absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  the foie gras was excellent however.  \n\nthe main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  the quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time i've had authentic prime wagyu before where i was charged far less for the pleasure. \n\n the one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  the presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  the dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  the free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  \n\noverall, robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  i feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  at half the price, i'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but i felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in vegas, i don't feel there's any reason to visit robuchon.  and i say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at l'atelier de joel robuchon in paris, which was exceptional all around.  if you do go to robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which i didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable. chef joel robuchon's restaurant is my siren song...love, love, love it!  a gorgeous little jewel box, stars removed from the casino.  the decor, bar, cuisine, wine list, staff and service, all so perfect, i could rhapsodize about the myriad joys i've experienced here forever.  the many, many times i've enjoyed the 16 course tasting menu, so truly scrumptious and amazing offerings, executed so perfectly and plated so exquisitely it's almost a crime to eat them!  executive chef claude le tohic is a true gem and helms the venue like the marvel it truly is!  my favorite restaurant in the country! the cheese course is now wrapped into the 16 course price.\n\nfavorite courses of the evening: \n*l'orange sanguine\nemulsion of blood orange on a wild berry gelee\n*le foie gras\ncarpaccio of foie gras and potatoes, covered with black truffle shavings\n*le truffe\ncrisy black truffle tart with onion confit and smoked ham\n*les crustaces\ntruffled langoustine ravioli, grilled spiny lobster in green curry, 'chaud-froid' of sea urchin on fennel potato puree with anise citris\n\nwine pairing prices for the degustation have four levels of prices, starting at $295 per person and going up $100 each level.  \n\nhazard: the two desserts of the even required diners to break the candied shell, part of mine broke onto where i was sitting and caused a choco mess.  good thing it was nothing a little soap and water couldn't take out.  \n\ngift at the end: they have removed the color photo book of the degustation menu.  a gorgeous milk chocolate caramel bar with dusts of gold and lavendar. if you're looking to dine vegas style, joel robuchon is the place to be.\n\nwe came here with 10 friends on the night before new years eve. while it's not the most adventurous meal of my life, it did delight me with all my favorites -- a black truffle trio, osetra caviar, foie gras, duck, santa barbara uni, etc... and an incredibly beautiful 3 course dessert.  it is culinary perfection in the most romantic setting. what more could you ask for? more caviar? well, you probably won't because their caviar portions are the most generous i've seen! bonus points for them there. \n\ni could describe the food, but if you're a foodie like me, you already know the drill -- the food is good so i will not describe every dish. you get everything that is absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection, and plated beautifully.  and the ambiance, while some may say is gaudy, is very thoughtful and there is much to appreciate about it. the walled garden in one room, a beautiful welcoming bar in another, etc.... there is much to appreciate about this place and joel robuchon's attention to detail.\n\nhowever, a few things that needed improvement or felt a little strange: \n1) one of the things i found tacky was the $15 water charge.  if you're charging over $800/person for the meal plus pairing, water charges should just be waived or just tacked onto the food charge. i see this as a terrible faux pas, especially for a three michelin star restaurant.\n2) someone was getting on-the-job training at our table. this would be ok but out of the three times i got up to use the restroom, i only found my napkin folded twice.\n3) joel robuchon has a fantastic limo service where they pick you up in a limo to the restaurant... but it was not available during \"the holidays\" much to our large party's dismay. it would've been nice to know this when we booked our table.\n4) the soft-boiled egg seemed more like a hard-boiled egg to me. it was cooked on a higher-temperature side of things.\n5) the wait staff is not in sync (all plates put down at the same time, etc...) like they usually are at this level of dining.\n\nthe menu was about $600/person, and my boyfriend and i split the most basic wine pairing for $250. at that price point, it better be perfect. and it was. but perfection comes with a downside -- it's that i think joel robuchon played it very safe. if you're a hardcore foodie, i think you may find the menu slightly on the 'safe' side (and in that case try \u00e9 by jos\u00e9 andr\u00e9s).  but if you're here for the vegas experience and want to try a solid 3-star menu with a fantastic ambiance, this is the place to go. highly recommend. definitely more of a 4.5 stars from me.", "XNrnspswrrB044gPFHSi8Q": "the copy and print center here is just so horrible. they have no

they must think i'm a weirdo though.  our waitress said the kitchen staff was confused by my request )\n-the fried chicken - enough to feed 2 people and the best we've had!\n-the sloppy corn bread- divine\n- the divolono (sp?) pizza - spicy with a hint of honey sweetness\n-craft beer!!!!\n\ncons:\n-the pretzels - 3 small pretzel \"sticks\" - maybe 4 would be a better number and they just seemed very small.  both of our orders also were cold.\n\n-our side of fries came in a large dish, but there were so few that it looked like we got someone's leftovers.  they were hot though, and my 6 year old seemed to like them \n\n\nall in all, we will definitely be back.  maybe not with our littles (they get bored easily).  a wonderful start and i can't wait to see state 48 become a solid 5 star rating! (we also can't wait to try their beers in a few weeks!) great new brewery in town! i had the state 48 brown ale and i was pleasantly surprised. it's a nutty brown ale with great flavor and a nice bite to it. very similar to the rogue hazelnut brown - which is one of my all time favorites. i also had the buffalo chips and they were decent - not bad - but certainly nothing to write home about. the only downside to this place is the overall vibe. the d\u00e9cor looks like they haven't quite figured out their style yet, so there's definitely room for improvement. if they can nail down the vibe - this place would be a huge hit in this area. beer selection is good. burger had no flavor. ordered the peach and prociutto salad. had 3 small pieces of prociutto and they were the un-edible fatty parts (couldn't chew it). told the waitress who said the manager told her it was fat (duh!). service was good.\n\nnot worth the $60 bill. too bad was hoping this place would be good.", "E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA": "grilled chicken on sourdough swoon. i love all of their food. and it's a late night drive thru. lots of healthy options.", "CvZi1UTIz6yw58R0kYqLcA": "i placed a custom order on 30 august. i was told it would be ready in 2 weeks. by early october i hadn't heard anything about it. i contacted carrie hood and asked for an update. she apologized and said it would be ready that saturday. i messaged her after i didn't hear back from her about my order that saturday and received an automated response. i have since messaged her several times and have received the same automated response. on november 4th i sent a message asking for a refund and again received the same automated response. this morning i attempted to contact rugged moose decor again only to learn that i have been blocked. i was using facebook messager to communicate with carrie hood. now i can no longer reach her and i don't have my order or a refund. this company is a scam.", "1VCK89mQPnDoGK0amBrYOg": "i was looking for a really good wings spot so i came here. wedges were soft and tasted good however could not really eat them cause it was over seasoned and heavy in salt. wings were ok not good for it to have \"wings\" in the name of the establishment, but to each its own. sauce ok. atmosphere was welcoming server was great. \n\nthe attraction for this place is good to get a drink with friends if in the area or if you want to try a different random sauces with names like \"voodoo\" then you will like. \n\nglass wear wasn't very clean\nentrance not easily accessible due to construction.", "HNQzTcyaW3PwJ2oC8vKWHw": "the good food is not worth the hassle of dealing with the lady at the window she treats the customers like dirt. on one visit i asked for my change and was told no you don't get change and had the window shut on me, the second time i paid for and didn't receive my side of sour cream and when i asked her for my side she demanded i dump my bag of food out at the window and show her there was no sour cream. i plan on never returning to this location as she is always working when i drive through.", "E_DXCeVllZtHV93hsAIZvw": "when to confirm all of the other reviews.\nservice: excellent customer service.\ncarne asada taco: greasy meat and tortilla, poor flavor.(wil be better with guacamole)\npastor taco: greasy meat, poor poor flavor.\ntaco de cabeza: good taco\ntaco de lengua:good taco \nsalsa: great variety, good flavor", "zFGqtqlZXQYYhBozM_ZpOw": "amazing. absolutely love this place. for pilates and barefoot bootcamp, martin and liz are unreal. janelle and mark teach an awesome trx class. strongly recommend that you arrive at least ten minutes before a class. \n\none of the reasons i love this studio is the number of classes they have in the day. i can go to the 5:45 and 6 am classes or hit the 7:15 and 8:30pm classes depending on my schedule. \n\non top of the great instructors and class times, it is also really affordable. especially compared to other studios nearby. this is the spot!

my companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. the salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. more restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! as for me, i ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. i have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. the result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. the entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup i'd sampled and fallen in love with already. i couldn't have been happier with what i ordered.\n\nthe clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. all in all we thought savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere. we would absolutely come back - hopefully my next meal here will involve sampling the amazing looking brunch menu!", "V2oe1HVgNK0He9Mf3Q17AA": "excellent idea and execution. i love that the pierogies rotate and then lunch special was very affordable. excellent service as well. when a friend told me there was a pierogi place near my house i was excited.\ni went and had dinner two nights later and saying i was happy doesn't do it justice.\ni had the kielbasa with cabbage and mushroom pierogis. i also got to try the meatballs with tomato sauce and the farmers cheese and chive pierogis. \nthe kielbasa was lean and tasty. both pierogis were great but the meatballs were fantastic.\non a whim i took the beef stuffed cabbage with mushroom gravy for lunch. it was very good but didn't compare to the meatballs. probably because the tomato sauce was much richer in flavor.\ndon't forget to visit the market next door. it has so many goodies including cracovia plum butter. simply fantastic. are you craving pierogis? all pierogi kitchen is the place to go to fulfill that craving!

awesome!  the pools are gorgeous and one pool has a sand bottom portion with a sand beach.   \n\nthe only thing i will say needs to change is the pool staff.   for the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what i found awful were the lifeguards.   the first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  there was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? neither did the lifeguards.   no kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  the second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  i get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.   \n\notherwise a fantastic stay.

have been reviewed many times by others as i think it's redundant, but i recently ate lunch at green valley ranch buffet and was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the food was so much better than the other station casinos that i thought it deserved to be reviewed.  i visited on a saturday and the casino was very busy.  there was a line for the buffet and it took about 20 minutes to get in.  i was seated and noticed that the chair was comfortable, something i hadn't noticed before.  i tried samples of various food.  the chicken was cooked properly and had a good flavor.  the mexican rice was really good as was the taco meat, seasoned well and was tasty.  the bbq sausage was good, and so were the bbq chicken wings.  the bbq ribs were tender and tasty.  i had apple cobbler and carrot cake with frozen vanilla yogurt (ice cream?) on top.  the quality of everything i ate was better than what is served at other station casinos.  the service was good and my drink was filled as needed and dirty plates were removed in a timely manner.  the wait staff was busy but were friendly and asked me if i needed anything several times.  sometimes it's the little things that make the difference or add to a pleasant dinning experience and i think gvr got it right this time. this is a very nice casino. it is yet another of the station chain, which i very much like. we enjoyed the gambling, and the buffet even more. if you are in the henderson area, this is a very good place to go. went for my birthday....we got a discounted rate ( but it's more then we usually pay). we got to our room....first all the curtains were closed...very very dark when you walk in...the room was nice, but then we had a balcony ( with a view...she said). there was nooooooo view....other then a view of a roof and a big wall. i wasn't happy with it and called down to the front desk and asked to be moved. they upgraded us to a bigger room that overlooked the pool for $ 10 more a night. the room was huge and a beautiful view. the hotel is just beautiful. i just love the fact that you don't have all the party type people from the strip mentality here. it's really not that far from the strip...if you go, but there is tons to do right near there. we will be coming back! we stayed here for labor day weekend . the hotel was very nice. the pool was nice and safe for my child  i was a bit disappointed because they didn't offer any coupons or free buffet like other hotels ... but did i mention the buffet was good for breakfast  the room was big and clean . ac worked perfect if i could give negative starts, i would. this place has thee worst customer service ever! they discriminate against people of different color and did not even try to hide it! the manager, was not helpful at all. i would put all of the rude people on blast if i knew i wasn't going to get filtered! i will be contacting hastings law firm for the horrible horrible weekend i had with my family there. we even booked the mediterranean suite because it looked to fabulous. later we found out the carpets have not been washed for how many years, mold in the restroom, and just plain horrible. \nthe worst part? rats rats rats rats rats rats and baby rats!!! ewwwwww!!! i felt bad for people who were having thier wedding held there because as soon as i saw the rats, i didn't even want to leave my room. maybe i

i was about 18! i'm 30 now... green valley had a special place in my heart. up until now, i have never not once felt discriminated on until i went to green valley recently. what a horrible mess it has become. \none more thing. the chlorine in the pool is to strong! i didn't even dip my head in the pool and my eyes were watery the whole time while watching my son.\nsorry but this place sucks. they

myself coming back to this place. had an opportunity to eat at the breakfast buffet on feb 28th, there is not much to say except, it was horrible.. the food was unbelievably bad, and tasteless.. eggs benedict should at the least have a sauce that can be identified.. this one was pale yellow, yet there was no taste to it at all, lemon was completely absent.. i have no idea what it was made from, but it certainly was not lemon or eggs.. while most things can be explained for bad food, stupidity is not an excuse.. the section that was serving the fresh bowls of fruits, water melon, cantaloupe,

there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). \n\nwe started with chips and salsa. the chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. the salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. \n\nthen, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. this was the highlight of the meal. not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles

kimchi and oyster fried rice. the fried chicken was so crisp it was unreal. the meat was still moist and succulent. the flaming chicken was tasty, well-spiced and flavourful too. the sausages weren't

the vets and vet techs come talk with you and help your pet. you're not in a separate room (like my old vet). this isn't necessarily a bad thing. i think for one of my dogs it was better because while he got blood drawn and a vaccine, he was too distracted to care - there was (what looked like a) lab/pit mix across the room who may have at one point looked at him! how interesting! and that golden over there! what's that smell behind me?\n\neveryone that works there is friendly, and they work quickly. since they work rather quickly, don't expect to sit down and have a long conversation. they

a little cheaper, but the staff seemed to hate their jobs and maybe me. another vet was more expensive but seemed nice. gateway? gateway was just right. gateway didn't offer me any discount, yet i

seemed well cared for while i was there, and got plenty of love. the microchipped dog seemed neutral (and wouldn't take any treats from the vet tech after she took him to get microchipped), but he pug

them again since dec.2016. and still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. i had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. so also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . this was a front end collision and then i had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  when i took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply?

transported to a euphoric state of pure deliciousness. so i ordered the dumplings and the hunan two. first things first you can order chow menu instead of rice, which was a hard decision but i went with the chow main. the staff is very friendly and there is a very cute fish tank while you wait, anyways pick up the food and get home. this stuff is amazing. the red bell peppers in here are amazing. they are fresh and lightly saut\u00e9ed, as well as the broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. this is a great portion for what you are ordering and the meat is nice big slices. the sauce is this spicy brown concoction with lil brown beans that are perfectly spicy. the chow mein is seriously amazing and also a great side size portion. these dumplings have to be some of my favorites in the valley and i have tried my fair share. this is incredibly worth it, better than most chinese take out by far. it isn't your typical take out. seriously give this place a try.", "GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q": "this is the second mastro's location that i have gone to. i've been to the one in thousand oaks, ca a few times and thought i would give this location a try. it is located in the crystals shopping plaza that is next to the aria hotel. this place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your sunday best. \n\ni made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a saturday night. we had a nice table an attentive waiter. we got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  there was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. \n\ni still went with the meat selection even though this was the ocean club. my boyfriend and i both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. the meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. the steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, i call it meaty symphonic harmony. \n\nwe also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. this is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. i was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). \n\ndessert is something that just can't be missed and i suggest the sinful delight of the signature warm butter cake and whipped cream. the butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. it almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. \nthis is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal. i highly recommend it. uh-may-zing!!! we will never go anywhere else for the best filet and seafood. the lobster mash is a must! this was our second experience at mastro's and it was better than the first. i am a fan and would highly recommend. samantha was our server and she hit all the high points. her attention to detail and insightful explanations make this restaurant a goto place in las vegas. thank you the food here is pricey, but well worth it. the sides are served family style so you may only need two or three for the whole table. the steaks are perfectly cooked and the cuts of meat are the best of quality.\n\nthis particular location offers a cool area to sit in if you are fortunate enough to be seated there. it is a pod-like structure that is in the middle of the hotel atrium. it feels very cool and adds to the experience.\n\nif you are looking to go big, this is a great place to do it! took my love here for an early birthday celebration. our waiter, johnny, was the best, so funny and attentive. \nwe started out with the lobster bisque and it was heaven! i had the petit filet with scallops, my bf had the kobe steak with saut\u00e9ed shrimps, we had the lobster mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts for sides. \nthe filet, steak and shrimps was delicious! my scallops was a little salty and slightly overlooked but still yum! the brussel sprouts was also salty and could use some shaved almonds and cranberries but overall good. \nwould definitely come back despite the whole meal cost me an arm, a leg and probably my first born. this is our 1st time at any of the mastro's restaurants.  we have family & friends in the vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  they were correct!  \n\nupon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed captain to recommend the appetizers.  he had us create our own \"seafood tower\" and we chose crab claws, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  the lobster bisque, clam chowder & iceberg wedge were next.  the five of us then shared a filet, chilean sea bass, atlantic salmon & scallops with garlic mashed potatoes.  our captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nnow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the mastro's butter cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nneedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy mastro's if you're in vegas!", "EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg": "from take out box right to the trash can. i've had

sliders that they ordered. \n\ni went with the streamliner, which is a vegan boca burger with regular burger fixings. i am not sure about the bun being vegan. they can substitute a whole wheat bun but this time, i didn't ask whether they were vegan. it tasted fine, the toppings were generous and the veg burger was cooked well. the only thing that i would change next time is that i ask for the bun to be warmed or toasted. it was a barely room temperature and it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the burger.\n\nthe service was great. our server was very attentive and friendly. she was very

in ohio. \n\nbut really, the neighbors were quite friendly and only one got frustrated at slow drivers in front of the house. he screeched his tires and cursed, but i think that's rare behavior in the midwest. perhaps he was from new york. \n\nthe house is great - you can walk up on the front porch and look in the back where ralphie shot his eye out. museum was really just a store. it's not a bad

but so worth it! we were in town for the weekend, and called ahead to make a reservation on a sunday. very friendly and hassle free process over the phone, and they even offered a ride to and from our hotel. the day of the reservation the driver was a little late, but they called to let us know, which was much appreciated. he only was 10 minutes behind due to traffic on the strip, which is understandable. when we arrived we only had to wait 20-30 minutes. the girl at the counter was super helpful and helped us decide which guns we wanted to try. surprisingly, the sten ended up being my favorite for the day. brandon walked us through the entire process, he was a great instructor, and very patient with us newbs. this is a bit embarrassing, but i somehow scratched my delicate hand while handling a gun, i'm usually a big baby, but brandon was such a gentleman and even gave me a bandaid. overall this is experience was amazing and to be honest i'd come regularly if i lived nearby. definitely will come back when ever i'm in vegas! i was debating between doing this one and battlefield vegas. i am definitely glad that i decided to go with the best bang for your buck groupon experience for two at gun garage. not only do you get to shoot more guns at this venue it seems, but it also seems more suited to novices as well. they provide you with transportation to and from the strip. the driver was nice and very conversational. \n\nonce we got to the gun garage all we had to do was fill out a form, show our ids, and listen to our gun range officer and we were ready to go. our range safety officer's name was james and he was extremely friendly and polite. he knew both of us had never shot a gun before and so he made sure he went over all of the proper steps with us more than once. not once throughout our entire time there did we feel intimidated. he even gave us support while we were firing because we had never felt recoil before. \n\nin all we got to shoot a lot of guns (9 i believe), much more than with the similarly priced deals at battlefield vegas. although the whole experience only lasts about 15-20 minutes per person it felt like a really long time probably because it was our first time shooting and because of all of the adrenaline pumping. i definitely want to go back and shoot my favorite guns with more clips since i now know which ones i like. all in all though this is definitely the perfect venue for people who have never held a gun in their hands before. bought a groupon, called in and got a same day reservation. was worried that they'd be booked up on a weekend. we did wait a bit, but i didn't mind. there were a lot of things to look at in the waiting area, plus you can watch people shoot off the 50cal. the girls at the desk were really helpful. our 'instructor' was zach. he was super sweet and did not rush us at all. \n\n*must*: you have to shoot the 50cal while you're there!!! what an experience!",

table. given the amount of people in our party, the waiters did an excellent job. the servers were polite, prompt and knowledgable of the menu. it is nice coming to place where your menu questions are answered without an eye roll and with confidence.\n\nwe started with the pretzel bun and fried shrimp with jalape\u00f1o appetizers. these were amazing. the breading on the fried stuff was seasoned nicely and the pretzel buns coupled by the cheese sauce were simply irresistible.\n\ni ordered the cubano sammich and of course it was delicious. the amount of smokiness in the pork was a punch to the mouth but in a good way. normally i don't like going back to work in a borderline food-comatose state, but this place was too good to not channel my inner fatty. i was reasonably impressed with ab. we got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so i'll aim for one of those next time). our server, robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. \n\nwe shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalape\u00f1o sauce. they could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. and for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: i had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. my friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. the bite i tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. \n\nthe decor was comforting in a british pub style. i wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, blt, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird \"arrogant\" staring at you. \n\ni do plan on returning for dinner, to see what catches my eye. we got the chicken club and the prime rib dip!!! french fries and side salad!! it was yummy!!!!!!:) only problem was not a kids menu. they will make a few items for the kids!!! the chicken tenders... the kids did not like them... not your normal kid friendly kid coating!!! everything was delicious! the crab stuffed chicken looked a little different than i had envisioned was the blend of sauce, with the chicken and crab was great! also, the chefs platter with cheese and was meats was a very pleasant surprise! we went last night for az restaurant week...i really like the atmosphere, much bigger than i thought it would be!  we had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  i got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  my husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  i'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  the entrees that we ordered were the jambalaya and the short rib stew.  the jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  we were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of phoenix magazine, kind of disappointing.  it seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  for dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert i have had in a long time.  i don't think i have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.  \n\nall in all, a really nice meal! fabulous service every time, love their menu and drinks...oh my god their drinks are fabulous! super cute restaurant and bar! we entertained clients there.  it's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  i give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.\n\nsort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  \n\npersonally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for bombay gin for example.   my co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.\n\nthe food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location i really expected more.  two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  the sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but i thought my salmon was really overcooked.  again, it wasn't bad, but i expected more.\n\ni probably wouldn't go back, as when i travel i like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe i just move on to discover something else.  i wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the \"trendy place to go\" and not because the food was outstanding. \n\n again, i think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  i would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop. wonderful food, enthusiastic servers who love their restaurant. nice decor, reasonable prices. we will definitely return. my husband and i walked in right as the doors opened and were greeted immediately. everyone was very welcoming and we loved the decor. our server tony offered us the daily specials, answered all our questions and even made suggestions. he was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. we had the pretzels with cheese for appetizers. they were the best we've ever had! our sandwiches were tasty and proportions just the right size. loved everything! everyone should give this place a try when downtown. they'll be thrilled with the atmosphere, people and most importantly the awesome food!!! i've been here a couple of times. the good: food is decent. good location to downtown events. nice patio. the bad: the quality of service leaves something to be desired. it is slow and sometimes non-existstant. some of the servers should be more friendly and take more enjoyment in their jobs. overall, this place is okay. will definitely give it another shot. great food and service! we ordered the shrimp appetizer and got the pretzels on a kitchen error as well. both were incredible!\n\ndinner was the burger and beet salad for us. pro tip: get the burger with bacon, avocado, and a friend egg. extremely satisfying and filling.\n\ndrinks and food came out quick and the service was great. anthony checked in with us just the right amount and was quick to get us what we needed.\n\na great place to stop when downtown - close to the stadiums if going to a game or concert. i made a reservation days in advance for nye, when we got there we were seated at the back of the restaurant.\nour first server who was a tall brunette, she was awesome. then a blonde came to get our order, she was very rude when i asked for no mushrooms on my strip. \"is that a allergy or just some preference?\" excuse the hell out of me? i worked in the restaurant business and never asked my customer that. you should simply agree and smile. she then gave my boyfriend the same attitude....\nour food came, it was pretty good. i was cutting my steak with the butter knife provided, she then came and pretty much slammed down a steak knife and said \"here is a steak knife\" and proceeded to storm off. \nwe watched her with other customers and she seemed fine with the one paying big bucks for appetizers and drinks, sorry that we were on a budget for new years. \ni just really didn't appreciate how we were treated. \nprobably wont be returning for another meal there which is a shame.", "aYyj9OdH059CoEXadmldXA": "i thought this place would be

arriving. no music just silence. i had shumai, nigiri, tempura,  fried noodles and oyster shooters. the food wasn't anything special i feel like it lacked taste. the side of fried noodles was just.... fried noodles, no veggies or meat in there. after having tempura i had to take benedryl on the ride home because i was having an allergic reaction to the shrimp which is caused by being undercooked. that was my first and last oyster shooter i'll just say that. i was really optimistic coming here but left with an allergic reaction. sorry bonzai. i'm over 30 years old and i'm a big girl. you can just imagine how many buffets i have eaten at. i have never been charged for not finishing our food. i can understand if it was a whole roll of sushi, or if it was self served. nope. the food was served to us, not knowing the size of the portions. we couldn't finish the plain noodles (no meat, no veggies) and fried rice that we ordered because we thought, being carbs, it would be smaller portions. nope again! then bam! they charged us for not finishing our noodles and rice. wow. not coming back here. i'd rather go and drive an extra 10 mins to oyshi or goyemon after this!! close to home so we wanted to give it a try. ordered a couple rolls (no avocado), tamago and a beef bento box. they made the rolls with avocado so they had to remake it. i felt bad but i asked them for no avocado when i ordered because i'm allergic. also, the spicy tuna roll was not spicy but lukewarm. \n\ndined at the bar and one of the chefs were right in front of us the whole time...he wasn't even the one that took our order or made the sushi. it was really awkward because only 4 of 8 bar seats were taken with guests and he was just standing there watching us eat. ah, so weird. there must be something else you could be doing...\n\nthe bento came out and the beef was good. they forgot to bring out the rice and when they did it was a little on the dry side. the waiters reached across and in

honestly say i am defensive of them because i have spent many many hours in the chair.  ms.betty at the desk is definitely in her element!  everyone there is upbeat and no one is ever grouchy!  vinny is magic with a needle for those of you who worry about that.  \n\ngo in some time and check it out.   get your questions answered and avoid possible hiccups down tbe road.  it is important to everyo e who is dependent on blood and blood products! went to this location. signed up the day before. my name was not on their \"check-in\" list, but i had my email confirmation. i have donated to united blood for many years. i was excited about donating because after traveling overseas, i was not allowed to do so for a year. today was my on year anniversary, meaning that i could finally donate blood. i monitored that date for a year, looking forward to the next time i could donate. so, i get there, my name i snot on the list and they say they cannot take me in because i am not on the list! so, all my preparation: eating well, being conscious about not doing certain things, spending time on the prep questions, waking up early, driving all the way to the donor center; nothing mattered. she didn't even seem honestly apologetic. she (della) just said \"sorry\", without truly caring. she even offered e a voucher for a burger. ha! i was there ready to give whatever blood kind they needed the most. all the beds where empty! all of them! i sure hope this doesn't happen at other united blood donation centers. what a shame that would be. united blood, specifically this center, need to remember how much effort their donors put into each donation and they need to focus, get their act together, and remember what their purpose and commitment is. for me, i am very disappointing. i will continue to help, but seeing this; it will not be with them. tip for donors: call before you start your drive to the center (even better, before you start your prep questions).", "FOqYmI24hSVP4EUibW-9zQ": "thank

pillows of heaven. you could also dip them in olive oil and balsamic that were brought to the table. i ordered the pssta fagioli soup. it was hot and hearty. i appreciate when food is served hot... i then tucked into a bowl of pasta carbonara. the pasta was a little thicker than i prefer but cooked just right and the sauce was spot on. my dining companion enjoyed a white sangria thst was visually

it took me a couple hours to figure out how to turn down the a/c.  small things.\n\nbut hey, they had free wifi and all the cable i could consume.  i felt safe in the parking lot because they have

treatments in the past) so she told me that this package would be perfect for me. later when i go in for my appointment they tell me that i have to pay extra for this body part and that body part! not only did they sell me the wrong package but they refuse to refund me my money and want me to pay more that i initially anticipated. they never sent me a reciept (as the purchase was made over the phone) and the laser technician literally spent 10 minutes with me for full legs and bikini and face! they are in the business to scam individuals who are new to laser treatment and have no idea what to expect. all i can say is stay away do not waste time and your money. they done less shot laser each time because they want to charge you extra for more treatments time. first time they used soprano(alma) it works with heating the second time they used another laser instrument that work by shot,so how can get a good result in this way???? laser treatments. \n\nlet me start by saying if i

because that sauce is so sweet and delicious.  almost sweet enough to be a dessert.) being in vegas for nearly 1 week, i was craving for something hot, spicy, and flavorful.  while there are numerous

good and many people came to play pool often at the 30+ tables.  the dart boards (7+) looked digital and something i wouldnt enjoy as i prefer traditional darts. the beer was priced well and there are specials each day.  although i thought the bartender could be \"quicker\".. the beer came out ice cold.\n\nthere was a fight at night which emptied the place and brought the phx police but it was something two idiots started. a-ok might be overstating this place for a \"sports bar'.  while they had plenty of tvs, i saw at least 15, they had rage against the machine playing and no sound for the games.  i heard a bartender say that unless it was a \"big game\" they could not turn up the tv volume when asked by another patron.  there were plenty of pool tables, maybe 20 and at least 7 darts games.   loosely this place fits the sports bar definition, the lighting was good and staff seemed hurried but friendly.  it was not crowded with tables and such which left plenty of space to move about and mill should you like.  the restrooms were clean and did have the sports tv sounds on so you could stand in there and watch the small tv if you like.  for a sports bar i would rate this at 2

than i expected. i'm really glad i took some culinary advice and listened the food was actually not too bad but the customer service of the actual server was pretty appalling when asked why the five top, 4 top and 2 top got fed before us. literally stop the server and ask what happened? he slowly walked away and said he had to check on our food. then we asked for the manager. it went well and she was kind and great customer service. thanks for making our stay a little better and sending us home with brownies. also she gave me a couple five dollar gift certificates to come again. overall the food was a seven out of 10. hopefully we get a different server.", "ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ": "one of my favorite places in phoenix. i like how their menu changes slightly over time, so there's something new to try. everything i've tried is good so far, and i've almost tried everything on the menu. i don't like the pig face dumpling as much, actually prefer the other dumplings. i love the stream buns, especially the chicken waffle and the pork belly steam buns. their ramen and seafood hot pot is excellent, but wasn't impressed by their duck dishes. if you're ever in phoenix for whatever reason, this is a must try.  i am a huge fan of pork so of course i got the pork belly ramen bowl and it was amazing!  however, my first choice would have been the duck curry bowl, but my stomach was at odds with me that evening. i must add everyone at our table felt the same way with their choices on the menu.  didn't have a problem getting seated on a saturday evening and we even sat outside with the heat but that was even a pleasant experience with the misters outside and no we didn't get doused with water;-) i've only come for lunch and i was very intrigued so much so i wanted to have dinner here. tonight it so happened my boyfriend and i came to have dinner and we were blown away with such stellar customer service. we met nick who is one of the owners as he walked around and made everyone feel so welcomed. he introduced himself and asked if we needed anything. after that we felt we had made a new friend. while sitting at their wok bar the second owner who appeared to be the top chef was so informative with the dishes. jarred was phenomenal and extremely thorough. he even made us a dish and said it was on the house. over all our experience here was the best i have ever had in an establishment like this. i will definitely come back.!!!! clever and deceptive koi-ness\n\nit's the middle of summer. pump up your ac! especially since your kitchen shares the bar & dining room and the majority of your dishes are hot, never mind your clientele. ;-)\n\n2 of the 3 stars go to:\n\n1) jarod: the epitome of a composed and well-conducted host. if you look up \"host\" in the dictionary, jarod's picture should be displayed. he was bombarded every minute from our arrival to when we were eventually seated. he was calm, collected and extremely pleasant. the best part, when he came to fetch us at central wine he said, \"your table is ready. don't rush. you waited for us. we will wait for you.\" *phenomenal* \n\n2) courteous wait staff: at no point did we receive any attitude to our hungry and impatient (did i mention over-heated?) dispositions. instead, we were comped and sweetened with desert and smiles.\n\nthe 2 hour wait to be served a semblance of food & beverage from check-in to seating is absurd. we arrived at 7:20 and were told a couple tables had bills and should be cleared \"shortly\". a stuffy 30 min later we informed our patient host that we would be at central wine (a fantastically cool waiting area). once we were seated (around 8:20) we were greeted, a beverage and app order taken - both were served together about 12 min later. thank goodness we had water refilled. seriously, it had to be 81 degrees in the dining room. we ordered our entrees right away.\n\ni have to say the \"special\" was quite tasty: salmon sashimi, seaweed, carrots, mandarin oranges and i believe some small grapefruit over brown rice. there was no way i was going to handle a steaming plate/bowl of anything in that heat. my husband was disappointed at the amount of duck in his massaman curry. the noodles far outweighed the 5, possibly 6, thinly sliced pieces of duck. and he was generous to share a piece with me, but once i saw how little he had i felt bad and offered it back. i tasted a bit and it tantalized the tastebuds but left much to desire ... more duck!\n\nperhaps friday night is not the time to dine at clever koi. i would like to give it another chance, as this kind of pleasant service is hard to find anymore. i think i'll wait until october or november to tantalize my longing for their spicy seafood hot pot. right now, i cringe at the thought of nose-planting from the heat into the spicy lava of tentacles. it's a trendy asian fusion restaurant with unique menu items and creative drinks.\n\nwe started with the pig face and goat cheese dumplings.\n\nthe pig face was pretty average. although pork belly and hoisin sauce is amazing the whole dish was overpowered by the sriracha but the goat cheese dumplings were great! the goat cheese was super creamy and melty while the sweetness of the beats were a perfect compliment. \n\ni have an obsession with ramen so i try to order it everywhere i go, so naturally i got the pork ramen. the broth was average but the pork belly was cooked decently. they also put kimchi in the dish and although i love kimchi, i think i would of preferred it without. \n\noverall it's an a nice place, good ambiance for dates or a casual dinner with drinks.", "Ph7iO3to0eyvZKqQ1kJ4PA": "went here for a concert in their basement venue. very cool space. intimate, cozy, nice ambiance. they seem to have a real handle on crowd management. the event was sold out, but still comfortable - they clearly take care to not oversell the space. you get the vibe of being in a friend's basement, except there's wine and better decor.\n\nthe wine itself - i'm not a connoisseur by any stretch. i thought it was good, but not exceptional. cheapest bottle is a $21 white blend.  they had a total of 4-5 varieties that night, with varying prices. \n\noverall, it's a cool place to see a show. might  go back for a tasting sometime to get a better handle on their wines, but they did seem slightly

grapes are crushed fresh in house (or at least in the presence of the winemaker, tim), so you know they're not rushing to produce a mass amount of products, just a handful of marvelous blends! my fave of the moment is the malbec. i've been really into it for a while now and really love their blend. i honestly have had some pretty bad ones, and this is true to form. i also think this is such a white wine type of area, i'm glad to see a place putting effort into promoting the reds.\n\nbut here's the other cool thing. they have a downstairs area that matches the same cool vibe of the upstairs. it's thee perfect place for an unique event. it apparently fits around 100 and would be the perfect pick for a small reception or a hip party. i wouldn't care what kind of event it was, i'd want to crash

tires me out. they need more and bigger/cleaner washrooms here. i'm convinced that the eaton centre is the modern incarnation of dante's \"inferno\". as in, it is hell. pure hell.\n\nbelieve you me, i love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but i avoid the eaton centre like the plague. oh eaton centre, how do i hate thee? let me count the ways:\n\n1) teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. the layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). \n\n2) it is said that \"variety is the spice of life.\" consider that the eaton centre has 3 aldos, 2 bell worlds, 2 feet firsts, 2 nutrition houses, and 2 sunglass huts, to name a few. is this really necessary? is it a secret ploy by the city of toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? \n\n3) the one redeeming quality of the eaton centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. parking is expensive. hordes of people travelling to and from dundas and queen stations and the path converge here. trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  \n\n4) the washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. high demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.\n\nfor decent mall shopping, yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores. well, who doesn't like eaton centre? i sure do!\n\nwe did toronto for thanksgiving 2017 and we had the obligatory visit to eaton centre for some shopping --specifically at roots, and with the convenient exchange rate, this was a must for our visit.\n\nwe had a quick bite for breakfast (food court is not life-changing, i should say) and then went on shopping. roots was our first stop and they were having this massive sale. got some things there. then tna, some sports store, and a couple of other things here and there.\n\nplace is clean, modern,

are here to drink and munch are the flatbreads. they are actually more like little pizzas, not flat at all and very good! very filling because they are doughy. finally, when i am craving a great burger, this is my go-to. trust me on this one. my normal lunch routine has consisted of cheap, fast food contraptions and bowls of progresso soup. so, a change in food was very much needed. my co-workers mentioned this restaurant a while ago. today, i decided to feed my culinary curiosity and order lunch for my co-worker (aka my lunch homie) and i. harry's grill and tavern, here we come! here are some of the items that we ordered :\n\nmapleleaf farms duck wings w/bourbon bbq sauce and jicama slaw\n\n1) initially, the chicken looked a little parched. last night's chicken? ummm, i hope not. however, the taste was decent. portion size was good. \n\n2) the jicama slaw was an excellent take on slaw. traditional slaw (cabbage) can sometimes become very boring. however, the jicama put a nice spin on it. the lunch homie, though, with her traditionalist, non-risk taking tongue, let the slaw fall gently from her mouth. you can't please every palate.\u00a0 \n\nsmall mixed green salad with raspberry vinaigrette and mac - n - cheese - lunch combo\n\n1) harry's mac - n - cheese was the greatest joy that i experienced during this meal! the consistency and texture was great...not too dry and not loose...just creamy goodness in my belly! the levels of cheesiness was outstanding. and the light sprinkling of panko crumbs provided that last bit of contrast and crunch. the comfort food gods have bestowed their blessings on this particular dish.\n\n2) bought the small mixed green salad to eat for dinner. the portion size definitely small, but it's packed with some good stuff. can't wait to get my greedy hands on it later this evening!\n \nharry old fashioned burger with a side of sweet potato fries\n\n1) my lunch homie ordered a harry's old fashion burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. i snagged a few and they were good. i've ordered sweet potato fries at other establishments and i've always needed additional condiments (i.e. honey mustard sauce)\u00a0 to add some taste. however, we both agreed that these fries were great by themselves. the slight sweetness of vanilla gave the side item a little more depth, while the salt reminds you that it's still a fry.\n\nshe was less enthusiastic about her burger, though. i believed she said that she had better times with a bk whopper. hey, i'm not a burger connoisseur,\u00a0 so who am i to judge? the presentation of the burger was well put together. wasn't sloppy or unappealing. just your typical pub burger waiting to be consumed.\n\nall items were moderately priced. my tab totaled to 31.12. our lunch take out order was timely ( ready in 15 minutes) and accurate. great location and if you're a non-parallel parker such as myself, they have easy access to the restaurant from the parking garage.\u00a0 i will definitely return to see what harry's has to offer for dinner and brunch. i must try the lobster mac - n - cheese!!! the bacon wrapped ribeye is delicious, so full of flavor! my friend had the salmon it was very good as well! great food and nice atmosphere! i went 3 times in two weeks if that tells you anything! lol fat g. coming from ayrsley. having got off the plane in charlotte and looking for a place to eat in town, we came across a place that looked nice and different and was actually open sunday night.\n\nharry's is a combination bar/restaurant in the town of ayrsley. surrounding the area are trees, small office buildings and the highway, along with some local businesses and such. when you go in, there is someone to greet you. directly in front of you is the bar along with some small seating on the left. on the right are some booths and tables for larger parties.\n\nthey have a small menu for food, but a larger menu for drinks and cocktails. i ended up ordering their burger of the day, which came with fries and one other side that i can't remember right now. the burger was big and satisfying and so were the fries, albeit a bit salty.\n\nwhat surprised me was the cleanliness and the amount of service they gave us. the server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager. i wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but in light of this review, i would consider it a positive aspect to mention.\n\ni wish i were able to review other food spots in the area, but even considering this was our only place that we went to eat out, it was a good choice. the place is good for watching the game, or hanging out with people. harry's is good food in a great location.  the service is top notch, the menu choices substantial and quality is

rolls as you want. i really liked sakana when it first opened, i went there for lunch a couple of times but because the 'word wasn't out' it was very slow, i was immediately seated, the service was quick and the sushi was good.  you could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  i returned there about 2 weeks ago for ayce and the experience was quite different.  i went early, about 11:30 a.m. because i knew they are much busier.  there were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  i ordered my first round and as i waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  i waited.  and waited.  and waited some more.  when my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything i ordered but i was glad it came because it took the edge off.  i slowly received more sushi.  the 3 orders of eel that i ordered never came.  i reminded the server.  she said she would check on it.  i waited some more.  i asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  even though the restaurant was practically full,

to be given water.  he kept trying to get someone's attention!  finally about 12:15, what i thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  finally my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  you could tell it was thrown together.  since i made such a big deal out of it, i ate it all even though i didn't like it.  i felt so sick after that, even though i didn't get my money's worth i didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  i was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when i arrived i was one of 5 people there.  then on the way out i noticed a dead roach on the floor, i nearly threw up.  the quality and service went way down with this place which is unfortunate. the best sushi bar in the united states the service was amazing they where going to close and still late us in too have a nice dinner at the bar where we sitting the cooks where great kind and happy and made our dinner great go here 100% this location is located right behind my office building. we start work at 6am. by the time sakana opens at 1130 we are well ready for lunch. \n\nthe food is so very good, however the service and lack of regard when it is mentioned is atrocious.\n\nif i call a business at the time they open(1130am) i would expect for someone to take the call. not the case with this location. i have had the phone answered, been asked to hold, then proceed to wait 20 mins for the person never to pick the phone back up.  \n\nif you advise them of multiple orders, they still pack everything together in as few boxes as possible making it hard to separate the orders. \n\nwe call in our order due to only having 30 mins to eat.  pre-ordered food is a blessing as it literally takes 4 mins for us to get there and pick it up.  going in and ordering takes 25 mins just for them to prepare it, which means no time to eat. \n\nso sad that i will now have to find another sushi spot that can be delivered because i can't spend any more lunch hours hoping they will answer the phone. what a great little place! \n\nthey offer a 2-for-1 drink specials all day everyday with all-you-can-eat for lunch and dinner 7 days a week, including an appetizer and dessert item! \n\nthere are literally over 100 rolls to choose from, categorized by style (baked, tempura, etc.) be careful though, anything you don't eat (unless you don't like it) they'll charge you for individually. i suggest (as do they) ordering little-by-little and opting for half rolls, when you can. this is to prevent people from ordering extra rolls \"to-go.\"\n\nmy friend and i sat down about 2pm on a saturday and the place was occupied but not packed full. our waitress was also very patient as we perused the menu over and over each time to decide what we wanted. running staff was attentive at refilling our water glasses regularly but the one odd thing was our soy sauce bottle was replaced...three times. three! the first bottle was half empty, the second 3/4 full and the 3rd completed filled. it wasn't obtrusive to our meal, just comical. \n\neven without the all you can eat, the prices were incredibly reasonable. it's not much for ambiance, but it looked beautiful and tasted great! great sushi, young crowd. this place has a california, urban vibe. they pre slice their fish so you get your food in no time and the wait isn't bad because of that. \nayce includes some great stuff! best ayce in vegas hands down! my wife and i go there atleast once a month, we love it. sorry for a lack of pictures.\n\nmy daughter wanted sushi, so yelp led me here.  she got her $5 california roll and i ordered their all you can eat for $25.  now, i'm not competition eater, but he couldn't have possibly made any money off me, seriously.  i ate about five $10 rolls, my favorite being, \"i need water\", which was spicy but not too spicy.  i had some specialty dishes that were fried, \"monkey brains\", being my favorite and i also had some sashimi.  all the dishes have less rice then what i'm use to.  it really allowed me to taste more of the flavors and not just get filled up with rice.\n\ni had my camera with me, with the best of intentions, but everything looked and tasted so good, that i couldn't wait to just dig in.  most of the sushi places i have been to, all taste the same, with very few standouts.  to some degree, we want a california roll to taste the same, but i have been looking for more flavor for quite some time.  i found it here.  i'm hoping he'll still be in business the next time i'm in town, because i would like to be back.  my fear is that he'll continue to lose money by people like me... 4.5 stars because of the great service and the rolls/sushi made with minimal rice. each piece of roll was not that big so it makes it easier to try more variety of rolls. we had a large party of 10 + 2 kids and they gave us the room to the front that was walled off to the side. that accommodated us perfectly! it was friday night too at 7pm and we were seated pretty much right away! \nthe waitress- raynee?- was very sweet and attentive to us. she even offered to split the check into two separate ones to make it easier for us. they also didn't make a big deal about several people in the party not getting the ayce but only getting a teriyaki plate. \nthere were so many rolls to choose from. yeah, the sushi was not the freshest i've tasted in my life, but was pretty good quality and i like the small cuts so it's not too filling. the skewers were really small and i think it was limited to one piece per. there were also a few other items on the menu which are limited to one per person. next time i'm visiting vegas, i'd return with several people again so we can try a more variety of rolls!", "4V2KN03EJMzaoOmLOy5UhQ": "love this place at all times of the day. they have great food with

told to call me without any details. i explained the situation, and he told me that parts rust and that's how cars work. i asked if it's normal for parts to rust and seize after 5 months of use, and he didn't have anything to say. he then said that i could have brought the car back to them so they could \"fix\" it (actually do the work this time), but i told him the work had already been done by my regular mechanic. he said it was too bad, because they have no way to compensate me. i explained that this was fine and i'll just continue to tell everyone i meet what thieves they are. he offered to have the regional manager call me, but it would take a couple of days because they are busy. i said this was fine, but it's been a week and a half and i still haven't heard from them. it's

reservations for the same day which was very accommodating. our table was ready even when we got there 30 minutes early. wow!  decided to check this place out tonight.  it was popping!!! drinks looking great. bartenders were hustling and killing it.  servers were professional looking and great , speedy service.  the food ?!! wow!!!! even the managers were walking around making sure all was well and one stopped too say hi and he was very nice.  i will be back.  great job!! this \"was* my go to steak house place in vegas. i come very often. this is my anniversary weekend and this place just ruined it. i asked for a certain bottle of wine per arrival....and once arriving i was told it wasn't available anymore. they has a different bottle as an alternate. fine. once getting the bill i notice it's a good $25 more than the bottle that i usually order. i ask then about it and (what i assume is the manager) comes over.  he asks me if i was made aware of this by our server. i inform him i don't even know how are server was because we've have at least 4 people serve us. which is not the norm when we have our usual server serve us. he informs us that hes going to ask the server if she informed us. if she did we would be charged accordingly..if not he would fix it. he finally came back and told us that she had informed us in which we said we would that's impossible. end of story they weren't going to discount us a dollar and we're paying whatever they say because they said so. \ni haven't even mentioned that not once did we get our wine refilled.....and we had to wait 1 hour to get our order fulfilled. worst experience ever. especially for a anniversary. i never not come here on my visits but this could be the last time i ever come here. i will reach out to the higher above. this was just unacceptable for a $200 meal for 2 people dry-aged new york steak & roasted rack of lamb (9/10)\nafter hearing the rumors and reviews of being one of the top steak houses, i came out to try this aged steak. it was beautifully refrigerated on display outside the stop. just by looking at it, i started to salivate. i must say the steak lived up to my expectation, the picture cannot do it justice. the tenderness of the meat was perfect with being too overcooked. getting medium-rare sab f meat had its own unique taste which complimented the seasoning really well. each bit was like getting a massage on my palate by the juice that sprayed out. it was quite mooving if i may say. the lamb rack was less spectacular as it was just average with a bit of tenderness in the middle but the outsides were a bit hard, probably because it was ordered as medium (who even does that). \ndefinitely would recommend this place as a stop after making some money from the casino. night out on the strip it's a must you stop by here if you are a steak lover.  the service is flawless! the drinks are impeccable!  the food makes love to your palate!\n\nthe amazing things i put in my mouth:\n\nbluepoint oysters:  fresh, cold, horseradish, lemon slices, chili sauce, and if i wanted tapatio trust me the service is so amazing that they would have found it!\n\njumbo shrimp cocktail: the definition of jumbo, excellent cocktail sauce with plenty of kick, and perfectly chilled.\n\nsurf & turf:  this entree is my food soul mate! this dish makes fatties sweat, makes red meat junkies shiver, makes sea lovers quiver, and foodies cream their seams! filet mignon, maine lobster, and served with this delicious drip off your lip herb lobster sauce.  made for the king of kings!!!!!!!!\n\nwent with a bottle of moet & chandon, my glass never was filled by me, as a matter of fact i think the service here is telepathic.  every time i even thought of serving myself more, poof like magic the waiter would be right there.  the waiter went as far as cleaning off the table every single time he took a plate or brought a plate.  the best part is he never interrupted conversation.\n\ndefinitely an excellent experience, one that will not be forgotten. well i have to tell you i am a little disappointed after giving them 2 try's. \ntrip 1- served me uncooked chicken (approx 4 years ago)\ntrip 2- just a couple of days ago... and let me begin by saying i love a great steak house and i gave this one a second try and passed up on trying a couple of others i hadn't yet. usually i go to the same place but i was in the mood for something different...\nanyways... i agree with a few of the other reviews - this is not prime it taste like usda at best - the meat is tuff and not flavor full & once again the meat was not cooked correctly (2 steaks ordered the same and 1 cooked to order the other not)\nbottom line. potato and ambiance okay, meat not great especially for a total ticket of $230 for 2! we've been here several times over the past 10 years and have always enjoyed perfection. so we were surprised to be disappointed on our last visit. we were in a hurry to catch a cher show at the park, so sat at the bar, ordered a bottle of champagne and ordered our meal. my salad came lacking the cheese the bartender had said would be on it. i mentioned it to him and he expressed surprise but didn't offer to get some for me. no big deal.  then the medium rare filet arrived medium well, and it was stringy, dry and tasteless.  we didn't have time to request a new one so i ate it. next day, i wished i'd sent it back, but with the champagne and everything, i didn't want to kill the evening. so very very disappointed. we've enjoyed several great meals at gallagher's steakhouse. this weekend we were in town with our kids and decided to meet for dinner. i went on line and made reservations and requested a table for six near the kitchen so we could see the grill. much to our surprise we were set up at the chef's table. the chef visited our table and provide great suggestions which turned out to be fantastic. the steaks are by far the best we have enjoyed anywhere in las vegas. this may not be for everyone but we love the action and the experience of a working kitchen. the food being prepared and the aromas are so great. i highly

actually provide me with what i ask for and what looks best on me. i tend to also look for inexpensive salons, which never really satisfy me, even if the prices were much more affordable in the end.  \n\ni went to parlour for the first time last summer. i booked it online (which is super convenient!) and booked myself with martha, as reviews stated she works really well with curly hair. \ni showed her pictures of what i wanted and she did a great job! she gave me a long bob that worked well with my wavy/curly hair. i returned back in november to do more layers and to cut my bangs, and martha did a great job once again. \n\nwanting to go blonde for the longest time, i booked an appointment with aimee this past december. i showed aimee what i wanted, which was a blonde balayage, and she was really receptive to this and provided good feedback on what would work best with my hair. my hair didn't turn out as blonde as i wanted because it would have been too damaging, but it did look good and very healthy! we agreed to return in a few months to add more blonde highlights to it. i returned today and she did a fantastic job. it's the perfect shade of blonde mixed in with other shades, just what i wanted. \n\nbased on my experiences, i've paid $60+ for my haircut and $175+ for my hair colour. this is more than i've paid for in the past, but it's also very reasonable and well worth it. the staff are not only talented but are incredibly nice and easy to talk to. i know that i will for sure be a long time customer at this salon.", "I6ICIIZfZsp_J9hHmfhWhQ": "i came right after the new year for my birthday thinking that everyone was gone already... nope, the party's still going! i walked here during the day and thought it was okay. during the night? that's when our fun start!!

their opinion of the us solely on what they see on the strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes.  \n\ni know, i sound like a prude. but as i see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, i have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.\n\nanother thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for \"dates\" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?\n\nwalking down the strip at night, i pray for humanity.   \n\nin the morning, it's actually pretty nice though and a good place for a run.", "h_4dPV9M9aYaBliH1Eoeeg": "very loud, wish i could give half stars, solid 3.5 but not a 4.  sausage was good beer was okay...just very pretentious and unnecessarily loud...put up some sound absorbtion. dining experience: lunch\nspecialty: german-style sausage hall\nmenu items: bison, wild boar and venison sausages with duck fat fries\n\nwho is in for a sausage party? well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.\nbefore we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read \"verst\". and its exact english translation is non other than sausage (figures). this recently opened spot in the heart of king west has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. with its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the friday lunch go-to place for most of us.\n\ntheir dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. all sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. when you arrive at wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...i did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. one thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.\n\nnow, lets talk about the product. from the list, my favourite is the venison style sausage. given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. you can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers and saut\u00e9ed jalape\u00f1os. the roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.\n\nanother one of wvrst's hits is their duck fat fries. fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. how this is done? a two step frying process. double-dipping is what i would name this frying method. the outcome? buttery and flavourful french fries. \nbut the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. my favourite, and one that i can not live without, the mojito sauce. dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.\n\nuntil next time foodies!\n\nbuen provecho,\nviviana.", "33N-oL25LxumJNft-ULXTA": "used to be really good with previous owner. since new

i was excited to try some interesting twists. my first cocktail was supposed to be \"spicy\" and it barely had any heat. if you're adding jalapeno to a drink don't be timid. my second drink was,

back pain, i searched for a good chiropractor and discovered dr warkentin at the ratemds website (under the top 10 chiropractors in the world) - what astounded me was that he had about 350 reviews (412 as of today), absolutely dwarfing the number of reviews for all other listed chiropractors - i also found out, to my surprise, that his clinic (actually a full-scale wellness center) was only about 15 minutes away - i made an appointment and was able to see him the same day - i had a full set of x-rays done - dr warkentin showed me the pertinent x-ray and provided an unrushed and thorough explanation of what was causing the pain in my back - he also pointed out areas that could lead to problems down the road - i was then put on a roller table, received electrical stimulation, had some adjustments done, and concluded the visit with cold laser therapy - subsequent visits added use of a spinal decompression machine - i also received instruction from his associate dr wolsey (who has a master's degree in exercise science) about how to strengthen my core muscles to provide support for my spine - after about 2 weeks worth of visits, about 90 to 95 percent of the pain was relieved // i've seen other chiropractors in the past - how dr warkentin conducts his practice blows them out of the water - it's evident his goal is excellence in terms of the quality of care he seeks to provide and the physical environment in which it's done (e.g. the patient restrooms resemble that of a luxury hotel; also, there is meticulous attention paid to upkeep, which explains why his large facility still looks new after 8 years) - in addition to being very personable and super sharp, dr warkentin is extraordinarily skilled at diagnosing conditions, going well beyond what the normal chiropractor is capable of doing (he's caught life-threatening problems that patients' physicians have missed, even though they're not in his official realm of expertise) - he attends surgeries weekly with some of the most skilled doctors in the valley (neuro, spine, cardiovascular, etc.) to enhance his diagnostic capabilities - dr warkentin also has a desire to give back - e.g. he goes out of his way to provide affordable care to fire dept and military personnel - another example:  he took a week off earlier this year to provide his expertise on a medical missions trip to africa // dr warkentin sets an example and standard of what quality medical care should be like - he doesn't market - he obtains all his business by word-of-mouth - and having experienced first hand how he treats his patients, i now understand why his marketing budget is non-existent - some of his patients fly to his clinic to be treated by him, rather than visit a nearby local chiropractor - you can add me to the list of his fans - almost forgot, one last item to mention: on the day of my initial visit, dr warkentin gave me a call later in the evening to see how i was doing  - it was completely unexpected - how many doctors bother to do that? - a most well deserved 5 stars!", "IrLTMLWZI1CzjXGQdjN1_A": "very helpful and does excellent repair work at very affordable prices. good selection of inventory as well.

i went for restaurant week and i will say the service was on point once we were seated.  for starters i made reservations online for when they first opened at dinner.  after making my reservations online, i was promptly called to verify the reservation and to be informed that if i am more than 5 minutes late then i will get bumped to the waiting list.  well, i was 10 minutes early and ended up waiting 15 minutes after my reservation to be seated...double standard?\n\nthe salad bar was on point with many different things to try.  my favorite was the seafood salad and the assortment of cheese.  as for the meats...i would say nothing particularly stood out in my mind.  i do remember thinking this one meat i tried that garlic flavored was good but clearly not memorable since i can't remember the name of it.\n\ni can't say i will personally be back but it is worth a try if you have never been to a brazilian steakhouse. we ate at chima for valentines weekend. the service was great, a nice salad bar, and great food. i have been to comparable brazilian places that weren't quite as pricey, but this is a nice dinner for a special occasion. we partook of chima this past sunday at the end of restaurant week. our first reservation choice wasn't sunday but it was the only time we could get in. this was my first visit to chima and my boyfriend's second visit. we arrived right at 7:30 and waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. the restaurant was pretty easy to find and valet parking was complimentary.  we ate upstairs which i understand is less crowded than the downstairs dining area.\n\nthe restaurant was right downtown charlotte and the decor was modern, sleek and warm. first portion of the three-course meal was the salad bar, which in my opinion is enough for a meal. i don't know if they offer that alone but it might be a good idea if they ever decide to open for lunch. it also might be appealing to those of us who can't justify spending fifty bucks there outside of restaurant week since the meal is just way too much for the average person to eat in my opinion.\n\nthe salad bar was very decadent and consisted of beef carpaccio, caprese salad, shrimp salad, a nice variety of greens, melon, soy beans, chicken salad, waldorf salad and few others items. there was also a wide variety of dressings, sauces for your meats, a couple different types of rice, three or four different soups, and bread with butter. \n\nafter visiting the salad bar you sit down and the men come by with a variety of meats. my favorite was by far the top sirloin; second favorite was the parmesan pork tenderloin. it was pretty salty but still good. i also had the filet mignon wrapped with bacon but it was pretty fatty for a filet. i also enjoyed the flank steak and chicken. my boyfriend really enjoyed the ribs. i also had the swordfish, which i found to be a bit dry, and the lamb, which was too gamy for my liking. while we were being served the meats we had other side items being served to us. i forgot to mention the appetizer, which were doughy parmesan rolls with a turkey dip, very good. the side items were fried bananas and some fried potato sticks, which tasted like hash browns. i personally didn't care for the fried bananas but i don't like bananas much anyway.\n\nbelieve it or not we ordered dessert. it didn't come with the meal but i wanted a little something sweet. so we ordered the cr\u00e8me brulee. it stole the show. we finished that off in about five minutes. maybe the best cr\u00e8me brulee i have ever had. \n\nservice was very good and i was pleased. i enjoyed the experience but i wouldn't go back for myself. it's just way too much food and i would rather savor one entree instead of be constantly paraded with more food while i

they skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. \n\nthe pricing at cpk has also become outrageous. it was almost $13 for my salad. for a salad! does anyone else find that wrong? considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. for such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. the service also sucks. our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. no refilled waters, no how is everything. she was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. \n\nso we all have made a vow never to return to any cpk. especially the one in the chandler fashion center. before i went vegetarian, i got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. that was a great experience.", "GBuB1uV9NRrtaLxZoVhi7w": "the maple bacon donut might be the best donut i have ever had. all of the donuts were super fresh and moist. there was a big selections. i will be back.", "8le6TQQwjAw_UQ67L8-Hpg": "it was a very interesting place. prices wise i rather go to popeyes or canes. what got me was the hair in my over priced chicken tenders. the fries were eh and the roll wasn't really rolling with me. save sometime and just go to chick-fil-a or mcdonalds. tried it for the first time, i got the 2 tenders with fries, came by fast. you dont order through a soeaker, someone comes out and takes your order. the girl who took my order was extremely nice. everything was great!

still everyone has a line not to cross. one of rex's is frozen pasta...the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket...lucrative, but rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. rex has brains.\n\nrex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience...so rex ran. he crawled. he climbed into someone's trunk. he eventually reached the closest place he could find...manhattan pizza.  it is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well...but ignore the warning signs and go in.\n\nthere are a few staples in an italian restaurant, and one of them is the chicken parm. if you can't make a lights out chicken parm then you should close your doors. manhattan makes a very good one. the chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. their red sauce is excellent. just the right amount of garlic and acidity. the pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. the next is meatballs. manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. lastly, can it make a pizza...a great pizza...and manhattan...excels! rex is more the new york style pizza kind of man. if you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. they do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing. \nthe truth about manhattan is the same truth people say about rex marvin...almost everything is good.  there isn't too much rex hasn't tried he didn't like. the fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks.  the pastas are all good and have good sauces.  the alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.  \n\nthe prices are too high. period. the food is good, but rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. if they dropped the prices rex would eat there a lot more.\n\nthere are a lot worse places to go than manhattan especially for the pizza. they do a very good job at new york style pizza, not perfect but a very good job.  they obviously care and try hard to make a quality product.  sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. rex can appreciate that. just like three legged midget maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. she always gives an effort...and in the end of the day...that means something.  rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something.\n\nmahattan isn't rex's first choice. it isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. it is really a 2 1/2 star place. order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good. normally it is just above good. for the money, you can do better than good. the pepperoni pizza i had was well done and my husband had a cheese pizza he very much enjoyed. i disappointed not to see some yummy chicken tenders. preferably in a hot style. besides pizza there was nothing really else on the menu that i desired to try. definitely come back for the pizza specially for the price it's a good deal.", "Zw9wEAk9L6oTZi63f4zVvA": "food is yummy, hot pots are affordable. only complaint is the long wait for service and food, but the food is good enough to keep me coming back!", "bFaFb7wu7swOp5qD8lNMog": "absolutely delicious!

chain a few years ago on a road trip to florida and as i was sitting in the car eating my cheeseburger wrapped in tinfoil (commenting that maybe we shouldn't have each ordered a fries because they're huge) i complained that we needed this in toronto. well now we do! haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. not much was lost in the cross-border translation. from the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come north. \nthe burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. i like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. the sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.\nthe fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. and, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. they actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.\nit's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your

be cooked appropriately so what else do you want?\n\nhere's my pro tip: when you go to the place where the drinks are right after you order, get a fortune cookie, but slip it into your pocket, then at the end of the meal, go back and say outloud \"oh man i am going to get a fortune cookie\" so they don't think you're taking two and then swipe a second one and eat it there.  they've got the most delicious fortune cookies and even though the messages are usually something stupid about sports like \"oh you're gonna have a good sportsball game tomorrow\" you can still enjoy the cookie, and

make the taco hard. at tacos and more, the hard tacos are the ready made taco shells like what you would expect from taco bell. i guess doing it that way saves the cooks time. aside from the terrible taco shells, the rest of the food here is delicious. i would recommend it for anyone not looking for hard tacos. be prepared to wait 45 minutes for 3 burritos!!! oh and it'll also cost you a small

when we wanted to move in. we told her we would be in touch, and got up to leave. she proceeded to do a hard sales pitch (probably because her boss was around the corner), and tried to get us not to leave. we left with a bitter taste in our mouths. we looked on their site later that evening and found that there were several apartments becoming available in mid to late july. guess we will take our business to one of the plenty other luxury apartments in old town. the broadstone stetson is very helpful. i have called multiple times asking questions regarding my new apartment, and they are always

express any day over this joint.\n\ni ordered to-go from their lunch menu: sweet and sour chicken with vegetable lo mein and rice ($8).\n\nit took nearly 30 minutes for it to arrive so now i'm rushing back to my office to chow it down. it's a good thing i didn't have to rush because the food was so bland i didn't even bother finishing it. \n\ni should have known it was going to be gross when my server pulled the lo mein out of a giant rice steamer. the noodles were not seasoned (btw- where were the vegetables in my vegetable lo mein?!) and way over cook. maybe it was because the noodles have been sitting in the rice steamer all day!\n\nthe sweet and sour chicken was pretty much non-seasoned, chicken nuggets swimming in sweet and sour sauce. there were some chunks of green peppers too but i couldn't get over the canned sweet and sour sauce that was infiltrating into my rice pile.\n\nthe best part of the meal were the fortune cookies. mine said-- next time, drive a bit east and you will find pei wei... or maybe that chicago hamburger company across the street will do too!\n\ndon't waste your money folks. judging from the 4 people eating there during rush lunch hour, this place will be closed soon. absolutely terrible service. ordered take out, showed up at the time they told us it would be ready. sat at the bar for 20 minutes without a server or bartender asking us if we wanted a drink or talking to us at all. over an hour after our food was supposed to be ready, the guy, supposedly the owner, comes up and hands us the bill. it was very overpriced. he didn't apologize and didn't explain why it took almost two hours to make 4 people's take out chinese food. \nthe food was also terrible quality. on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, i'd give it a three at most. i had beef chop suey that had very little flavor, and my brothers both had chicken chow mein that had almost no noodles in them. \nthe staff was inconsiderate and there was no excuse for their tardiness, as there was maybe 5 other patrons in the restaurant. \nthere are many other good chinese/asian restaurants in the area, and needless to say, i will not be coming here again. positive: the food! we had soup, chow fun, and the peking duck. the chow fun was exactly like at home. the peking duck  was served exactly how my sister liked (lean, less fat). also, great service. my sister and i felt incredibly homesick after eating here. \n\nnegative: i wish the peking duck was served on a bao instead of in the wrappers; however, my sister informs me that the wrappers are more traditional. sushi

was fine.  i guess i would've liked to see her smile, but aside from that, service was perfectly attentive.  several other people checked on me as well (i assume the gm or owner).\n\ni went with the egg flower soup to start and the mixed vegetable with tofu dish.  the soup was kind of bland.  i thought about sending it back, but i added a little soy sauce and kept my mouth shut... the entree was delicious... the tofu was golden brown and the perfect texture and the veggies were crisp and delicious.  \n\ni will order carry-out and even return to dine-in at autumn court again... maybe next time

turned me off on buying a new car any time soon. \n\nthe other day i received a personal text from bryson asking if i was in the market to buy a new car, which i have been. i told him what i wanted over text and about my juke and finances. he was able to write up a deal and call me with the info which made the process easy! saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. and they got my interest rate at 3.24 when avondale nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when i had zero credit. my credit  is in the 700's so there is no way i should have been ripped off at 7% like avondale nissan tried. \n\ni was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership. at pinnacle they gave me $12000 which significantly more and paid off my previous loan; even giving me some extra towards the price of my new murano. \n\ni was impressed by my experience. john in financing was fantastic and very good at explaining the process. bryson was also very helpful in making the process as easy as possible. \n\ni'm picky and the murano i wanted wasn't available in arizona so they found it in nevada and had it shipped. i was told about 4 days and put into a loaner murano. my new murano came in a day in a half and is exactly what i wanted. \n\ni appreciate the professionalism of the staff here. i don't think there's ever a great time to take your car to get it fixed, but i will admit this was pleasantly seamless. \n\ni felt compelled to write a great review because looking at some of these

it.  went there with family to go hang out.  apparently, there's a dress code there which prohibits nike shox.  according to the bouncer, they are trying to foster a business casual dress code.  ok, fine.  more on this later.  luckily, i live close by and grab some nicer shoes and it met the bouncer's approval.  unfortunately, he didn't mention the cover charge, which took me by surprise when the cashier told me to fork it over.  even though it was $10 for locals, who ever heard of charging people to get into a bar?  whatever.  i pay my way in and met up with the gang.  service was slow, music was way too loud and for $8 for a domestic beer did not impress me.  remember that policy about the business casual dress code?  funny thing about that.  as i was out on the patio, i happen to spot a guy in shorts and tennis shoes wandering abouts.  selective enforcement perhaps?  in short, it's over rated and overpriced! recently was there with a few friends. have been in the service industry for nearly 20 year from bartender to security to gm and like. what i expect for service execution and attention are often rather high. the attention received from the staff was wonderful. our bartender cassandra was one fastest and attentive i've ever had the privilege to watch. a smile and a thank you with every single transaction as well her head on a constant swivel. paying attention not only to guests but her teammates as well. as we had no food our drinks were never empty and water was offered at nearly every exchange. we'll be back again soon! terrible interaction with the local community.  let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, blue martini does not take reservations on sunday night. they actually are attempting to change a bar restaurant into a night club on sunday nights. \nneo-soul, a promotion company operating on sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on sundays.  on sunday august 7, 2016, i visited the blue martini as i always do several times a month.   during my visits i normally spend  around 100 dollars.  after checking online banking i discovered that i have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid may.\nyesterday i ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  i waited 45 minutes for my wings.  i look forward to eating bm wings on sunday since it is the only day that i eat chicken.   half way through my chicken wings a neo soul representative came over to where i was sitting with a retired engineer.and a va nurse.\nthe unknown neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  the first thing out of his mouth was \"other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. he further stated, i have to ask you if either of you two are disabled\" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. i was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while i ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. i assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for profit.  the promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of restaurant regulations.  \" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool\".  meaning,if a patron orders food from a blue martini bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  must be provided. blue martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for neo soul to increase it profits.  the neo soul rep. appeared surprised when i produced my armed forces veterans disability id as if he was not expecting that. i explained to him i was a desert storm veteran and retired from the armed forces and las vegas metro.  he then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  i was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that i could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  i asked him if there was an emergency and why i could not eat my last two chicken wings.   i explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  he said \"let's take the disabled veteran out of it\".  i asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. it is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  the neo soul rep also felt it necessary to have a blue martini security officer stand by as a \"show of force.\" we took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  neo soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that neo could increase profits.  neo soul is confusing blue martini with nightclub practices. neo soul and blue martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant/bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  lastly, he continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  \n\nneo soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are \nfalse. the first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. \n\nsecondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  \nlastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  \n\nthe entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the neo soul rep.  the rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  i would like to reiterate the fact that,  you absolutely cannot make reservations. this entire \"rigged system\"  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional neo soul reps desperate to make more money. \n\ni asked  to speak with a manager at this point.  this manager can only be described as stocky, latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  he was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the neo soul representative's behavior.  he further stated that neo soul rep was unprofessional and to contact scotty m immediately.\nadditionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and i said \"thank you but if you could give us some drink tickets instead. one thing is for sure...having a hospitality card is such a perk. 50% off everyting! including food. \n\nif you show your \"grinder\" app on mondays you get a 50% band.  we tried to show the bartender, but i think you have to show it upon entrance.\n\nlobster dip - my favorite by far.  the crackers are really good.  it has sesame seeds on one side of the long rectangle cracker.  can you say addicting!\n\ni've had a bunch of their pizza and theiy're all not bad.  \n\ni haven't been at martinis for over a year now and i was surprised that they didn't search much  in the extra shaker anymore. = 0( i was a little bummbed\n\nthe bartenders were very nice and accommodating! plus! one word for you: yikes!!! \n\nthis is a milf bar in a mall to begin with. double strike for me. so if that's your thing, you'll be in heaven. overpriced mess of a place overall.\n\ni've been here three times to really make up my mind and each time i ask for \"well\" drinks the bartenders end up pouring me grey goose or van gogh and then when the check comes they pretend that that's what they heard me say. last time all i had was two double vodka soda \"well\" drinks and got a bill for 45 bucks cos the bartender poured chopin. it's a really dumb scam and i've fought it each time. just be on the lookout for it. nice little place with an outdoor patio. mosquitoes like to gather when

restaurant under $30 per plate in champaign-urbana, and it's the best food in that price range that i've had in extensive traveling in downstate illinois. it's nationally recognized for quality, and it shows in every aspect of their food. the barbecue is flavorful but never dry. the sauces are varied and incredibly tasty. their sides are delicious. their sweet tea is to die for. they have a great selection of craft beers. \n\nthe only problem is the wait - they're such a popular destination that you'll frequently have to wait 15-20 minutes (or more) for a table at peak mealtimes, but with their new champaign location starting to kick off, that might start to get better. \n\nif you're just passing through and only have time for one meal in champaign-urbana, do yourself a favor and make it black dog. this place is without a doubt, the best bbq in illinois. my boyfriend went to u of i and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. well, i suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. but don't be discouraged! the wait is well worth it, i promise. \n\ntry to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. there's not much space in this place. i guess that would be my one complaint. it can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. however, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? now, let's talk about this beer.\n\nthey have new selections on tap all the time. please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (miller, bud, heiniken, corona, etc). those are just fine for any regular restaurant. why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? seriously, these beers are amazing. they come from different breweries across the country. places/companies you've never heard of. combinations of flavors you would never think to try. i once had an oyster beer here. sounds disgusting but it was so good. trust me on that. i'm very picky and i liked it. you can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). this flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. you can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!\n\nnow, on to the food. so so good. there are a few different sauce choices you can get. not being one for spicy, i get the georgia peach. it is soo good on anything you get. there is no bad item on this menu. the pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. the brisket is also amazing. they cook it for 12 hours. how could it not be? try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. while it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. this way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. they cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.\n\ni know this was a long review, but i really can't say enough about this place. i'm obsessed. it's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near chicago. however, i will make any excuse to go down. going there this weekend for halloween. can't wait to visit my favorite bbq place in all the land! i just wish this places wasn't so packed all of the time, but with food as good as this, what do you expect. i have only tried a few sauces (carolina and georgia peach) and they are awesome. i get the wings every time i come here. i have tried the pulled pork, catfish sandwich and even a burger. the food is always great. i just really wish i could sit down and enjoy lunch here without a ridiculously long wait. who doesn't like good bbq?  i ask you?  good, though...like so many things in champaign, i found the ooohing and ahhing pretty over-rated.  it's good food, no doubts, and their burnt ends?  you'd travel the globe for these suckers!  but.. their brisket is often dry(ier than i'd like), and i am sooooo not a fan of pulled pork that sometimes has globs of fat in it (it might be that _all_ pulled pork is susceptible, i am just not a fan! =p).  regardless, you have so much to choose from (http://www.blackdogsmoke.com/menu/), and don't be stingy with the sauce!  i'm a true carolina girl at heart, and black dog does this carolina red that's vinegary and tomato-y, and has a bite to it that'll just.. well, it'll make your mouth water.  other's really like the hot georgia peach, like the most exquisite combination of both heat and sweet!\n\nall in all, you're going to get a fabulous meal here, and for champaign-urbana il, it's some pretty legit bbq!  pair it with one of their amazing beers (and the choices are endless! http://www.blackdogsmoke.com/beer/) and you'll

a row but got only a small amount of temporary relief. i thought about going to a chiropractor, but remembered how many times my friend had tried to get me to see her acupuncturist and decided i should give it at least one try. boy, am i glad i did! \n\nthe needles are very, very fine and i only felt a small prick with a few (not even close to either a vaccination or finger stick)-- this was not a painful procedure. he inserted 16 of them from my neck to my ankles and then asked me to guess how many were there. i guessed 6-8. i seriously didn't even feel the others and none of them hurt. they then hooked some kind of electrodes to 6 of them (i was lying face down and couldn't see what he was doing) and sent weak electrical pulses through them. if you've ever had tins treatments, the amount of current was far less (no muscle twitches) and felt as if someone was gently tapping my back in each spot. then, they turned off the lights and played new age type music while i relaxed. i don't know how long that lasted (maybe 15-20 minutes?) because i didn't have my watch on, but it was like taking a nap. after this time, they disconnected the electrodes and removed the needles. i felt very calm and a little groggy at this point. i had told him that i would be playing poker later that evening and he recommended that i take a nap when i returned to my hotel. i took his advice and when i awoke, i felt great! in fact, i was even able to walk from caesar's to bally's later to catch the free shuttle without any pain. sure, that's not a great distance, but there is no way i could have done that prior to my acupuncture treatment. i got a second treatment the next day (my last full day in town) and when i left las vegas, i was pain free. just today (about 10 days later) my lower back pain has been bothering me again (though not as severe), so tomorrow morning i will look up the local doctor whom my friend recommended. i hope he is as good as dr. lok! if you are in las

these folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. my brother moved to scottsdale from minneapolis. he arrived well ahead of his pods container. however, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. when he called them he was told, \"oh yeah. the container arrived last week.\" it never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.\nnext was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. problem is, no one at pods location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. all they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. since when are the internal logistics problems at pods any concern of the client? thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.\nand then there's the challenge of trying to contact pods. all communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. so, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! you get

furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.\nbottom line here is that until pods matures and figures out its

i'm listening to casey kasum tip hits from 1978. what is the target demographic? this isn't the only time i left due to terrible ambiance. i'll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. i hope they will find an identity. ordered delivery for me and the kids. two hours later, our meal arrived. i called to inquire after about an hour. was told that the delivery was on the way. minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. do you think it was on the house? nope. just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. not good enough. \nnow, let's talk food. the meatball \"panini\" was a piece of french bread with a bland/acidic sauce. the meatballs were overcooked and dry. not a pleasant experience. the pizza sauce was also watery and bland. you'd think that a place called \"sauce\" would have figured it out by now. not so. food was mediocre, at best. i ordered an appetizer & it just okay. nothing special. i returned that & asked tiramisu which was also \"eh\".  i don't recommend this place at all. after one visit at lunch and one visit during dinner visit in the last two months, sauce is a-ok. various coupons/discounts are available for sauce which we used on both visits. groupon $18 for $30 was used on the first visit and yelp deal $50 voucher for $25, which was found on the yelp app, was used on the second visit.\n\non our first lunchtime visit, we were sat in the bar area and i took the recommendations of our server bernadette. for the appetizer, we had the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese. for entrees, my wife had the california panini and i had the italian chimichanga. the common thread with our appetizer and my entree was the mix of pesto cream sauce and the tomato based marinara and arrabbiata sauces. i didn't think that was a good pairing. i might have the fried cheese again but without the pesto cream sauce. i wouldn't get the chimichanga again. there's too many ingredients (meatballs, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, mozzarella, and feta along with the arrabbiata and creamy pesto sauces) that just didn't meld well together.\n\non our second visit, we were seated on a saturday night with one other table in the dining room. we ordered the kids fettuccine alfredo, the sauce sea bass (they were out of sea bass and salmon was substituted), and the create your pasta consisting of fettuccine, signature red sauce, meatball, roasted garlic, and mushrooms. if you're a garlic fan and not looking for any kind of make out session after dinner, order roasted garlic with your pasta. there were a total of about ten cloves of garlic in my pasta. for dessert, we had the zeppoli which was probably the best dish of the meal. even with the lack of business, service was still slow. everything was ok with this visit with nothing being bad, but nothing being that memorable.\n\nthe menu is large with a mix of traditional dishes and different creations so it's highly probable to find something of your liking. we just didn't score with either of our visits. i'd come back here if we had a discount or deal as we did with our previous visits and maybe we might find the dish that is right for us.", "buTa1akbH0pO_P10v99_eA": "it was okay! it definitly wasn't bad i just don't think i would go visit again. i didn't really like their food choices or the way their

"62HlThvB9Rm2QFu_OdXe7w": "great restaurant in the sheridan square neighborhood!  we sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful night with misters.  the service was friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was nice and the food was good.  i started with the pork spring rolls and followed it with the lemongrass chicken.  both were very fresh, flavorful and tasty! debated on going 3 or 4 stars for the review. i would say that the firecracker shrimp, garlic noodles, selection of fresh spring rolls, and shaken beef deserve a 4 but pho is maybe a 3 and their crispy spring rolls is probably a 2. \n\nspring rolls: they have a great selection of some traditional and some really americanized spring rolls, but nevertheless, their spring rolls are great. my grandmothers and vietnamese restaurant-owning relatives probably wouldn't recognize half of the spring rolls they sell here, but they're tasty. my favorites? the spicy asian (chinese sausage, imitation crab, sriracha, jalapeno, some sort of crunchy stick) and the enlighten me (this one's vegetarian). \n\npho: average. this would not be the reason to come here, although i do get it from time to time. it's not the best, it's not the worst i've ever had. the broth is so-so, unremarkable. also, i don't get cilantro with my veggie plate, which i think is really weird. \n\ndrinks: they have a great selection of fun cocktails. \n\nstarters: get the firecracker shrimp with the garlic noodles. they go great together!\n\n service: hit and miss. sometimes, things can be really slow, but lately, things have been pretty good. heed the negative reviews.\n\nthis restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. i wish i had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. the positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. one spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. they were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. the peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.\n\ni had the lemon grass chicken for dinner. the chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. i couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. the presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.\n\ni'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food. \n\nas i said, pay attention to the negative reviews. if you like bland, overpriced food, you may like this place, but otherwise i can't see anyone going back for more. been multiple times and love all the rolls we've tried and the firecracker shrimp is so addictive. the owners are a hoot and so friendly. definitely try a vodka-soaked lychee...so good. parking is very limited in back so you may have to get creative with where you park. i love the restroom sinks made out of woks and the music is soothing and a

it were a little longer. the time just rockets by.\ntry it - you'll like it .... i saw this show on april 8th, so it's been a while. it was the greatest thing to ever happen to me since i discovered the beatles themselves. everything was authentic. the songs, the costumes, their impersonations, everything was top notch. to be fair, george looked kind of old to be doing the part, but all that aside it's still a great show. so if you're a beatles fan on a trip in las vegas, give this show a watch. this show is all about managing expectations. if you go in the show expecting some type of

yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! \n\ni first came to shabu grill all the way to this section of lv because of an uye hosted by debbie n.  the event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.\n\nso when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  the food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  the restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  it just worked out better for us.\n\nthe main reason i like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is diy, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  i love the fact that i can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before i can order more or something else.  \n\nthe diy sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  not as extensive as comparable restaurants in socal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  but it is pretty hard to score a total fail in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  the important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.\n\ni would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.\n\nnote:  there is a \"bar\" in the front when you walk in, but they do not serve alcohol at this establishment.  but if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a pt in the same strip mall.\n\n\n\nreview #2 of 2014 i was excited to try this place after hearing so many good things about it. i was quickly seated, ordered the half regular, half spicy hot pot, and went to gather my food while the broth came to a boil. \n\ni was very impressed with the variety, especially the seafood: 3 different types of crab, scallops, clams, mussels, and even lobster. not sure if the seafood variety is like this every night or i just happened to visit on a special day. a selection of noodles, vegetables, and meats (beef, chicken, pork, and lamb) rounded out my choices. each of the refrigerated items were portioned out on styrofoam plates and wrapped in cellophane, which i thought was a little wasteful. in the center of the restaurant were a bunch of desserts and some cooked items such as fried rice, pad thai, etc. the theme of the non-refrigerated items was thai. as mentioned by others, there was also a condiment/sauce section.\n\nboth broths were fine. the spicy broth was not that spicy and did not cause any numbness, but nor was it very oily. the meats were just okay, very lean, so they ended up a little tough after cooking. the lamb (a classic) and beef (eye of round?) were my favorites. i am not a huge crustacean fan, especially if i have to shell them myself, but i did enjoy the shellfish. the desserts were okay, nothing special. the meats could have used a little more marbling and an extra waitperson would have helpful. during weekday 12-4pm, it is only $23.  you don't get desert.  we went there on a thursday.  it wasn't too crowded, we get very good service.\ngood selection of seafood items and vegetables.  i like the lamb,  it tasted good but a bit tough.  the soap base is just ok, but not as good as the ones at the noodle place in gold coast casino.  they charge $17 for the lamb shabu already.  it makes this place a good deal for $23 weekdays.\n\nwe went to the rio seafood buffet on sunday and it was $45.  so again , it is a pretty good deal if you like seafood and go for lunch on weekdays.\n\ni highly recommend this place for shabu on weekday lunch only for $23.", "Y1Yprra4ZSyAIMW9Zm75dA": "again only 4 stars cuz i

i replied right away with the details... but the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. there was no response. a few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. i replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. i was anxious with the impending july 4th weekend, but held hope i could still make contact. i decided to call. \n\nunfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. that friday after work, i called and was immediately sent to voicemail. i got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. i left a voicemail explaining that i badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and i asked him to call me  back asap. i really needed the july 4th specials. \n\nthe weekend came and went, no reply from chris. frustrated, i went to a different dealership in scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful cmax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend

work out so come end of september i ended up scheduling a d&c. at that appointment he expressed that i probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage. he didn't know that by now????? smh...already frustrated with this location & this doc i was told i had to get went a follow-up. i did & he didn't even check me (didn't undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if i was trying to get pregnant again right away, if i want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. this doc didn't seem to care about my well being and didn't care

was not worth it! was maybe 4 bites worth of food. there was one other sushi roll that wasn't worth the price but i do not remember which one it was. other than those two things, the rolls were awesome and they almost couldn't finish everything. \n\nsince i don't eat seafood, i got the chicken katsu. i do believe that it was overpriced for what you got ($14 for 1 chicken breast, a little

his bedtime wasn't far off, so i didn't want leave him with a sitter and therefore not see him at all. i wasn't planning on staying long. when i asked the hostess about the party that i knew was already seated, she informed me i couldn't go in since i had my son. she said they have a strict no one under 21 policy at all hours. i read a review from january that mentioned  kids, and they don't say that on their website, but ok. i explained the situation, and asked her if i might just visit the table to drop off the card and let my friend know that i couldn't stay. she said no. no offer to take the card in for me, no offer to let my friends know that i was outside and not allowed in, just simply no. and so, that will be my last visit there.\n\nupdate: the gm reached out to my friend who booked the party, and then mailed me a personal letter of apology and a gift card. went there after the first of the year, received great service, the food was wonderful. nice change from the prior

lighter for lunch. if you are looking for a modern style japanese restaurant with super fresh and beautiful food, try this place, you won't be disappointed! best happy hour!!! very rare to find a

coffee on the side of course.\n\noverall, i think this is a sweet place for people who would like to study or work in peace but still be surrounded by people (does that make sense?). it's one of the

way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. the fries were on a greasiness level of their own. i have never had such soggy fries.

asada, but the lady talked me into trying all of them and they're the tacos that are about the size of a silver dollar maybe a little bigger, nonetheless i ended up trying a fish taco, a shrimp taco,

the golden nugget, and it's right past one of their checkin/out desks.  looks super fancy.  i thought everything would be crazy pricey (super cute + vegas = $$$ to me), but surprisingly, their ginormous cupcakes were just $3!! and their chocolate-dipped macaroons (or sans-chocolate, same price) were ... shoot, incredibly affordable is all i remember.  and, it's not like these macaroons were *just* dipped in chocolate either -- i saved these as a treat for myself, rather than sharing them with my friends who were celebrating the big 3-0 (i'm a fab friend, what can i say), and it was like a truffle was stuck to the bottom of those macaroons, talk about a delightful surprise!  honestly, i don't have much experience with macaroons other than visual, but the softness and coconuttiness (not too much) were very appealing.  and back to those cupcakes -- huge.  delicious. i got one red velvet for one friend, who shared a bite with me -- moist, tasty, cream cheese frosting was perfect.  i carted around the other two cupcakes for the rest of the trip, and only got to sample the chocolate-chocolate -- also delish.  \n\nnutshell: if you're nearby (ie, downtown), worth the stop.  would i make a special trip downtown just for these? despite the 4 stars, i can't in all honesty recommend the hassle it is to get downtown if you're staying on the strip for a short time.  but come on, who

my file. i called a month or so later to order contacts and was told i could not pay for the contacts when i came and picked them up; i needed to pay for them over the phone. i have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but i figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. once i got the statement for my order, i realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. i called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. they never did, so i called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. after going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and i would receive a check soon. never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. in fact, everyone i talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. a month later, i received my refund along with an updated billing statement. amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. it read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". this is the first

should make a reservation. i did and off we went. when we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. we took our

came i got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup i would have been amazed. the soup was adequate. it has a nice balance of all the flavours i am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. i mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant i got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. what really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 egg roll and the 2 hargow for $4.50. this place was way over priced. so maybe the service was going to be exceptional. i mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. the 2 hargow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes i have ever seen. we ordered moo shu pork, chinese broccoli and the house special fried rice. the food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. far too expensive but very good. ended the meal with the deep fried creme brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.\n\nfrankly i can think of a number of places that i would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. cynthia's chinese restaurant is no longer one of those. as a comparison the meal at cynthia's paradise would have cost $54 for two

times i seriously wanted to shout out, \"get on with it! we get it, they have a penis!'' \nthey poorly incorporated the zombie aspect of it. they created the show around the idea that zombies are hypersexual beings and kept trying to hammer that into the show. zombies loves sex. zombies love sex. there, i just told you the whole show. \n\ni honestly couldn't understand the singing. i don't

jokes... and let me tell you, i am all about offensive jokes, but these ones were just tasteless and fell completely flat. i just wanted the host to shut up. they really did not make it clear anywhere that this show is more of a musical and an attempt at a comedy. \n\neven the burlesque we got was a little disappointing, because the girls were hardly made up as zombies, if at all! i didn't expect

vehicle. you simply use the dealerships control number on the green slip to enter in the dmv website and it will bring up the vehicle you bought. you can then transfer or request new plates (standard only plates) and the dmv will mail them to you. this is handy, because we all hate the dmv. \n\nback to my review of autonation buick gmc of west sahara round 2. so i got the green slip and i was \"just looking\" at some of the buicks on the lot. buick has come along way in the last 10 years or so. this is not your grandfather's or grandmother's buick anymore. i had a 2013 lexus es 300h that got 39mpg highway and 40mpg city. it had quite a few bells and wistles. anyway, i began by driving a v6 powered 2016 buick lacrosse and devon and denzell were my points of contact again. i really liked it. this one didn't have the same equipment that my lexus does, so i didn't really want this particular car, as i didn't want to go down in car quality or caliber. then i drove a 2014 chevrolet impala v6, and loaded with everything for that model year with 22k miles and they were asking 25k for it. i really liked this car. it wasn't a lexus or a buick, but it was cheaper than either one of those and it was fully loaded. but i was contemplating replacing my business car, which was my lexus, and i already had a v6 powered malibu that i bought for 16k with 32.5k miles two weeks earlier from this same dealership, and the same sales people (devin and denzell). it took me forever to decide even after driving a brand new 2015 buick lacrosse that had just about everything my lexus did minus the front parking sensors and the dash cam, but i can replace the dash cam later (which i will at this dealership for both my malibu and lacrosse). i got a heads up display system with forward collision alert, i got a bose audio system, a panoramic sun roof, remote starter system, and a wifi hotspot powered by onstar. these features my lexus didn't have. \n\ni was given multiple options, and a lot of time to decide which vehicle i wanted out of the three, the chevrolet impala, or the 2015 v4 eassist buick or the 2016 v6 buick. i ultimately chose the 2015 eassist v4 buick lacrosse based upon what i was going to be doing with the car, showing real estate. i was offered an unbelieveable deal too. because this vehicle was a 2015, and was sitting in the showroom, and the 2016's were already here and more were coming, this car was priced at 35k. originally it was 41k which was understandable. if i bought my lexus es 300h brand new, it would have been 47k easy. i know cars, and how to shop for the ones i like or want. so i knew i was getting a deal on this new car. also, i was given a 2k tax credit for my lexus, and autonation gave me another $800.00 off on the car, because i am a repeat buyer, and i didn't waste anyone's time. thank you david! \n\nso i still had 1k of negative equity to deal with, and that was done by lowering my interest rate from 4.9% with lexus to 3.9% through autonation buick gmc's contacts. can you say credit unions anyone? if you want great financing go see the fine people at autonation buick gmc, they will find you a good deal, if it takes all day. they don't just use traditional banks or manufacturer banks like most dealerships do, which all charge higher interest rates, trust me i've been there. \n\nso in combination of lowering the interest rate again to 3.45%, and further dropping the price of the new 2015 buick lacrosse, i wrapped up my negative equity and came up about 2k. this shows in the contract as down payment money which is true because i verified how the dealership got the numbers. so i got a brand new buick lacrosse, with an extended warranty, prepaid oil changes for 3 years on top of the 2 years given to you by gm (general motors), theft protection and gap insurance and my payments are $616.00 per month versus $647.00 a month with lexus without the theft protection, or the prepaid maintance plans. lexus doesn't offer standard oil changes for the first 2 years either. \n\nwhat's more, my buicks engine, transmission, and final point of assembly are in the united states of america. just like my 2011 chevrolet malibu. the major components of these cars are made here. just read the window sticker, it will tell you where the major components are made. we need jobs in this country badly. i don't need bernie sanders or donald trump to \"bring back the jobs\" to the united states. we can all do our part by giving gm, ford or even fiat chrysler a chance. personally, i am a gm man. i loved my lexus, but i love my country, my buick, and the sales team at autonation buick gmc even more. they also hire the veterans! thank you again everyone @ autonation!", "tgFRjCbtcm0fBBq3hJ2L-g":

ok well the price is pretty hefty. not gonna lie. and the sides aren't exactly the most tasty things ever but combined with the cheese, usually anything will taste good. but be warned, the server will

years now and it typically doesn't disappoint. their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy.

hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.\n\nanyway, i've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. my favorite meal begins with a plate of their \"church basement pierogies.\" they cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. they are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. then i like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. i really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. supremely delicious. i will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. so the consistency is not 100% there. but nine times out of ten, i'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and i'm a happy camper. and then i pass out in a carb-induced coma.\n\nthe downside here is, of course, their prices. they are pretty expensive. i recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and i had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  so be prepared to have your wallet

never once asked us or gave us towels to dry...other customers had to until we asked her. mind you no apology for the spill. the manager even came over to clean up with no apology but rather cracked jokes!  moved to a new table & she quickly drops off more drinks (on the house) & almost spilled them all on us. thankfully the new waitress took care of us.  i mentioned our meal should be on the house, when  manager comes over to say they can do the drinks only. after all, it was only water!!  the nerve!! we had to tell him it was drinks other than water. poor customer service from manager and waitress.  had to ask to comp dessert. not recommending to anyone!", "bM1upMzv7Xl-qElyxp0OKA": "worst place i've ever been , they don't care at all about you. it is badly run and badly organized,

amount of hate-on going for ol' sam's, so i've decided to come to their (honest) rescue. first, let me give you some context:\n\n1. this is not the place to come for authentic chinese cuisine. abort mission if that's your goal. go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand.\n\n2. this is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. you will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. \n\nseriously - these folks put up with a lot. a lot. can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? it'd be like babysitting 100 children with adhd who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. so i chose to cut them some slack.\n\n3. i liken this to being the denny's of chinese food. it is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. you love it while your eating it. you tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it.\n\nbut in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. if you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive.\n\n4. on a diet? yeah, no. not for you.\n\nyes, i too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the beltline. i have slithered their noodles down my throat and i have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. i literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time.\n\ni've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. the place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. just make sure you bring cash. they get a bit ornery if you try to pay with debit/credit.\n\npro tip: stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. you might get dirty looks, but i've never been yelled at - yet. mmmmm, 5 pounds of calgary's finest imitation asian cuisine. \n\nis 4 stars probably pushing it? yes. if i could i'd give them a 3.5. but as someone else mentioned, calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved alphaghetti.",

very decent, authentic indian cuisine, that the customer service is so deplorable. my parents and i went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. they had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. we were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. when it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. the owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? \nummm, say what? \nfirst rule of customer service, the customer is always right. and even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you apologize for being late. and you don't make snide comments. \nand here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the wrong order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. so we called the owner, hetal, to note this error. instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. no, it was us who had placed a wrong order. my father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? i don't have to listen to you, i've opened restaurants before, i don't need to be told how to run it. \num, actually, you do. because you are rude, unprofessional, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service i have ever encountered. this is america, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. \nand it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out. but this place is not worth all the undhia in the world. it left a really bad taste in my mouth and we will never step foot in there again.", "QARy4UUOQogMjDp9jP-YVg": "hubby and i shared the pork belly and the short rib small

need a reservation but was able to sit at one of the high tops near the bar.  the table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.\n\nwe started out with the cheddar bites.  they were mini, dense and rather not great.  its almost like a failure attempt at recreating red lobster's cheddar biscuits.  the shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from nola.  the meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  the duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.\n\nthe reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  these were the kinds of dishes that you might see on master chef or hell's kitchen.  but they wouldn't be winners by any means.  \n\nthe place is kept cold.  we were near

generally three types of sushi places.  the very small, packed place that has the run of the mill sushi, the convert belt sushi, or the fancy schmancy type with renamed sushi rolls and a few not so common.   \n\nin my view kofusion is, at least this location is the fancy schmancy type and the prices to go with it.   nonetheless they have some unique rolls and have more than just sushi.    so if you have friends who are adverse to raw seafood, they'll be able to find items such as hibachi chicken or beef, along with rice or noodle dishes.   \n\nthe service was, just okay.  for as few people there were at the time we visited, i felt the service could have been far better.  my suspicion is the kid was nursing a hangover, but he was friendly and he did get our order right.   \n\nas with most sushi places, when the two platters of sushi rolls came to the table they presented well and certainly there was pride in the work.   the rolls were nice and tight and didn't fall apart from plate to mouth.  the fish, especially the salmon was very fresh and i liked the special sauce used on the spicy tuna.    \n\ni would certainly come back here again, although if you've not been to the mongolian place just up the road, i would suggest giving that a try too.  both places are excellent.  \n\none other point.  if you happen to be over by the collage, there is a small kofusion place by

this was one of them.\n\nthe place was rather empty, but that's because it was halloween evening.\n\nwith that being said, the interior design is pretty cool but feels a bit cold. i had a couple of things on the menu. i had the halibut as my main dish and the california roll just for fun. i was very stuffed by the end of the evening. i liked both dishes.\n\ni think ko fusion needs to focus on one cuisine. it's trying to be everything to everyone. but what i had was tasty. the outside signage says 'steak pizza sushi seafood.' what the hell kinda combination is that? i'd go back if i was in town. :) this place was across the street from where i was staying when in town for a wedding.  a group of us came to dinner before going bowling and the guy who helped us was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  the ambiance in this place is really nice and i loved the fish tanks.  the tea we ordered was delicious.  i believe it was jasmine.  the sushi was good and many at our table got the

with a rhubarb compote, a paresan with strawberry and another cheese which i can't remember with marmelade - fantastic!\n\nfor my main, i had the gnocchi which was really good and my friend had some kind of pasta with lemon and ricotta (she really liked it but it wasn't my thing).  both were around $20\n\nwe wanted a little something extra so we split a trio of sorbet - bergamot, rhubarb and mango - the rhubarb was my favourite\n\nall in all, a great night.  the service was excellent, the room was really nice and the food was awesome (and reasonably priced).  my only complaint was that our cocktails were really small and didn't appear to have much alcohol in them.  i'd stick to wine if i went again. we went to buca for a pre dinner show in january 2013. yep, i did not forget the

a few tables for our 530 pm seating but they seated us near the kitchen. the service was not great until my daughter arrived and ordered  wine, (i don't drink so i had to settle for mineral water while waiting for her). \n\nthe not-so-sure: the portions of everything were tiny. after ordering  3 breads, 4 cheeses, 4 pastas, salads , meat platter, and desserts, we were still hungry. may be they cater to peopl with tiny appetite. for almost 280 bill, we were hoping for a bit more,\n\nthe need-improvement: the servers were a bit indifferent to cold, and may be they preferred the folks who ordered bottles of wine ... we had a pregnant woman and a non drinker... genuine italian food.  very pricey wine list.  hidden location, unless you know. buca is a lovely intimate space to celebrate

yogurt and herbs on top. the raw trout was fatty and meatier-tasting than tuna sashimi (as a benchmark) but the preparation kept it light and balanced. the most adventurous dish of the night was the cervello. it's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap. it sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese. it was a fun dish.\n\nof course, if you

crab didn't do it for me.  my wife liked it, though.  so if you don't like seafood in your guac like me skip the seafood options.  my favorite was the pinapple habanero.  simply outstanding.  next

dinner.  heck, the guac was more than enough.\n\ni ordered coffee and jalapeno bread pudding for dessert.  coffee made with cinnamon and brown sugar?  was amazing.  the bread pudding had the jalapeno

very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so i would if i could, but i honestly can't).  allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch. \n\nmy friend and i were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a sunday.  it was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  the atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  i already felt very content as i sipped my oj, little did i know that i was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  it seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the scotch-ish eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. the service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  on paper, the scotch-ish eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  i am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  i have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  i can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!\n\ni'm excited to return to the white brick kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the scotch-ish eggs, i am definitely in for a treat).  i loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  great spot, great staff and sublime food. you really cannot ask for more! this is by far one of the most amazing places for fried chicken and waffles. they offer the fried chicken in 2 varieties: original and hot. i chose the original and it was tasty and not oily at all. the waffles were fresh and soft. i also ordered birthday cake super shake and it was nice but nothing extraordinary though it had colour sprinkles. the place is tiny and have an outdoor patio as well. i went on a friday evening around 7 and waited about 15-18 mins to get a place for 2 since i didn't want to sit on the patio. \nthere were only 2 servers and they were friendly and didn't bother us constantly unlike someplace where they want you to eat and leave. even though all the tables were taken, they didn't mind us sitting after we were done our meals. this could be due the fact the kitchen had closed and were getting ready to close. \noverall, i enjoyed my time at this place and will visit again in summer to enjoy the patio.", "cw4m6QjZVG2PkdSYeim1Gg": "i love this park, and my dogs do too!\n\nit's

person would expect from a recently renovated, small 'locals' casino -- clean & modern 24/7 cafe with a basic menu, decent food & cheap to fair prices.\n\ni ordered the onion rings as an appetizer, & the meatballs & spaghetti as the main course, however, as a vegetarian, i asked for just spaghetti marinara -- no meatballs!\n\nfirst out was a small salad, which comes with the entree.  it was good.  next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   the onion rings were pretty greasy, as i suppose most are, so i'm not complaining, however i do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully i'll be home by then!   i do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something! \n\nthe pasta course was good.  instead of them bringing parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.\n\ni was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of meatballs & spaghetti ($8.99) since i asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, i was charged full price.\n\nmy bottom line:  decent food at an ok price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (i don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- i came here because i was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and i don't see a reason to return.    but if you're a local looking for a small, clean & friendly place to gamble or hang out at the bar & watch a game on tv & while you're here already,

(note: i've been here once before for post-dinner dinner since the fattie in me got hungry again. ate their chips/guac & sonoran dog & it was good. get it if you like dirtydogs). \n\nas i was saying, the set-up is nice because the outdoor area allows you to enjoy the food while having an audible conversation, but if you're curious about the live band/dj/show or want to just vibe with the music you can sneak inside and grab a drink by the bar. and perhaps you like what you're hearing and want to dance it off ... the dance floor is yours! our cover charge was $5 at the door for guys/girls ($3 if purchased online), i'm not sure if that's always the case. i really liked that they have these \"bleacher seats\" extended across the back wall so if you're tired from dancing or maybe you don't like to dance at all but just want to enjoy the music, you can just chill back there without having to  pay for a table or deal with all the inconveniences of a swanky club.  big plus for all you ladies in heels who need to rest your poor little toes!\n\n*parking: plenty of metered parking and lots.. use them! i thought we snagged a great non-metered spot for free on the side street, but it was a fail & i got a parking ticket for being too close to a fire hydrant :( so watch yourself!", "aqMfCbFNeWn1a4Evds83fg": "$12 after tax and tip. the sandwich was really tasty and the dutch bread was outstanding - both crispy and chewy - but i had a sour taste in my christhole after spending so much for a sandwich. yea, i wished there was one in va. meatless mike rocked my world. on point! husband had a tony soprano and he was happy. great selection.  just awesome!!! first time here and words can't express how happy my stomach is. so flavorful and tasty. got the madison bumgarner and barry bonds. the madbum honey is strong but agrees with the bbq wonderfully. barry bonds is simple and satisfying. love to see the taste of northern california here in az. will be back much more! go giants! i liked the variety of sandwiches available.  my mom and i each got something different and then traded a half so we could sample a couple of them.  by far my favorite thing was the fried zucchini with pesto dipping sauce.  the zucchini was perfectly fried deliciousness and the pesto was fresh and wonderful.  the girls at the register were friendly, but they did miss a couple of special requests we made.  in their defense, we were new to ike's and asking lots of questions.  the mistakes in our order weren't bad enough to complain about or send back the food.\n\nultimately, the reason i'm rating ike's 4 stars and not 5 is price.  we felt it was a bit pricey for sandwiches, although they are huge.  two people could easily split one.  so if you're a penny pintcher like me, bring a friend and share a sandwich.", "zeKmH-EPyxEugnuJsjpYlg": "it seems this lenscrafters has two account, so i don't mind post on both. \n\ntheir policy(30 days adjustment guarantee) is great and the specialists are professional and nice. however, the managers(a man and a woman) are terrible. i deeply felt i was treated unfair and discriminated either because of my race, or because the purpose of my visit was to fix the glasses's problems.\n\ninstead of fixing the problem of the eye glasses they provided, the male manager would prefer to spend time on getting new customers. i went to lenscrafters to fix a problem of my new glasses and unfortunately it was a busy day for them. he said to me that he would recommend me to come another day because they were busy. before and after he said this to me, he didn't say the same words to all other customers who needed to get a new glasses or to pick up a glasses. he quickly assigned them (many people came after me) to specialists' tables and let me wait at the shopping area for 30 minutes. was that because i was asian, or because he didn't taking my request(fixing the problem of the glasses) seriously?

(rta). they also have connected walkways to progressive field, and quicken loans arena.\n\nthe skylight concourse is definitely something to see; this four story (+) tall atrium overlooks the cuyahoga river hosting a food court and cinema. here you can grab some stir-fried veggies at sakkio japan, bourbon chicken at kelly's cajun grill, or just a warm pretzel from auntie anne's while enjoying the scenery of  downtown cleveland and ohio city.\n\nthe holidays at cleveland city center is truly a sight to see. in december they have a 40ft tall christmas tree with larger than life hanging mechanical ornaments, gingerbread village, and the best thing ever, the twigbee shop! here you can bring kids under 12 with their shopping list for parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles and a volunteer helps the little ones buy gifts under $10 that are pre-wrapped. \n\nbesides all the cool shops, you can truly just get lost in this place and enjoy the sights and sounds. eat, drink, shop, eat, drink, shop... how can you go wrong with that. if all else fails, go blow your shopping money at the casino.\n\none of my favorite amenities at city center is the subway. cleveland's rta rumbles below the center giving you the feel a bustling metropolis. here you can jump the sub and go pretty much anywhere you want in the city, and the mall resembles an oldtyme train station. just the architecture alone draws me in, i can spend an entire day meandering the halls, people watching, sipping coffee and munching on some delicious treats.\n\ntower city center is a safe, clean, and fun place to take the kids, watch a movie, or blow your paycheck, just remember to get your parking ticket validated. i went to this mall a few months ago while on a school trip. really great mall! it

hoping that the second time around would be better and it was!\n\nthis time around we went and ordered another bottle of my now favorite wine sexual chocolate, it's a syrah - zinfandel blend and it's

blown away by nearly all of them. the only one i wouldn't order again would be the spicy tuna pops. the tuna itself was amazing, super fresh and really flavorful. the waffle cone that it arrived in didn't exactly compliment the fish. \n\nother items that we ordered and loved were the dozen oysters, we got an assortment of the oysters they had that particular day and they were fresh and this time around there wasn't a trace of shell in any of the oysters! woohoo!\n\nthe crispy cuttlefish was one of my fav items that evening - the only way to describe it is that it is very similar to calamari

salad is what dreams are made of! i love wedge salads but i usually am not a huge fan of the iceberg lettuce since it really has zero taste or nutritional value to it. the bibb lettuce was a welcome

i can only give them two stars because when i got to the veggie section of the ordering process the sandwich wizard started just throwing things on it, luckily i noticed it was mine and i had to speak up and he grabbed the things off the sandwich which i didn't want.... always love when they just grab them off. then the real reason i cannot give them a positive review was the manager told the man

behind the counter just stared blankly at us and asked if it was dine-in and handed us menus and told us to sit where ever, so ok cool. it took about 10 minutes before the same guy came to us to approach us and ask for drink orders, and by this time, 2 other tables have sat. he was the only apparent server so i was trying to cut him slack (i work in the restaurant biz), but if you were the one who handed us menus and serve us...10 minutes is a stretch. he let my drink go empty twice, but partially my fault--i was thirsty. didn't really come by and check if we needed anything, we eventually got what we needed ourselves by reaching onto the server's counter (sorry). there were about 5 tables in there around the time we went (6pm-6:30pm), so it wasn't that busy...service could've been better in my opinion. \n\nfood and pricing: i ordered a medium bowl of pho dac biet, probably the most common pho in any pho restaurant. the portion was smaller than most pho restaurants i've been to, and more expensive than the other pho restaurants i've been to. it was about 10$ for a medium, and in my opinion, was not worth it. the broth is more on the bland side, so season well with the condiments. probably about 6 pieces of meat in there max, so if you like a large portion of meat in your pho, don't eat here. i also ordered an order of spring rolls. they were eh, okay. they're small also compared to other restaurants, and of course, cost a little bit more than other restaurants. \n\noverall: it was a whim coming in here, i probably won't be back because i live in charlotte and was just in the area. if i was from the area, i'd probably try somewhere else also. the portion of the food just didn't match the price, you can find better pho elsewhere. even if that

different therapists before finally finding one who is amazing.  the first therapist i had was terrible and i felt like i wasted my money.  the good thing about this facility is that there are many therapists on staff so if you don't like one you then you can try another.  the other therapists were good for first timers or clients looking for a non-aggressive relaxing massage.  i enjoy high

if the light was still on. if the light is on, that means the chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!\n\ni enjoyed their tang soo yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. this came out steamy, hot!!! tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. the oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. the sauce that completes this dish consists of

the jjampong. although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. it was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. the spices didn't really do it for me and i

worked very hard to make sure we had a good room. he really wanted to make sure we had a good floor but couldn't get us a king bed on the floor he wanted for us so i took the two queens which isn't a

is good size for downtown. the only things i would have liked the room to have would be a coffee maker (we brought our own instead) and a refrigerator (which is rare downtown except at the main street station). the floor we were on was quite and didn't smell of smoke. in fact i think in the three nights there i only saw one other person on the floor. maid service was always prompt and thorough. she

from tips about food, but rather, planning your night there.\n\nat tomo, when they ask you where you would like to sit, choose the hibachi grill or the left (left as if you were walking in through the main door). if you sit on the right side, tomo shares an adjacent wall with a noisy night club, and your table will thump with hip-hop music. this obviously isn't their fault for having noisy neighbors, but it can definitely hinder a first date or good conversation.\n\nthis also goes for choosing when to eat there. i recommend friday night, before the bar crowds start rolling into the neighborhood. you'll find better parking, and it will be a quieter experience. as for the food, the sushi at tomo is quality for the prices, but be prepared to spend a little more than usual. the presentation is beautiful, and the service is fast considering their busy warehouse district location. i absolutely love the indian roll and the sexy girl roll, and i must mention how nice it is to have a hibachi downtown. the sushi is worthy of a visit, but if you don't have time to sit down, they will never fail you on takeout.", "jHB0Rb_xjcUy5po-XQAB-A": "great service, alcoholic drinks reasonably priced, food wonderful!!!!  can't wait to go there again!!!!!  huge difference from the previous owners!!!!!", "WCqcYtJ4rUxA4bIzjOfzqg": "(2.5/3) for first timers, this 'restaurant' is organized a lot like a high-tech, italian-only food court. walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). it's convenient and not too crowded. apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. \n\ni ordered the pasta vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). it was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. however, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. the pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. like past reviewers, i also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). my friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"the anchovy flavor was great.\" i also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go. \n\nfinally, i had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when i went to check out. fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. overall, i would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly. it's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants. despite other glowing reviews posted about this location, i cannot in good conscience give a good review.\n\nvapiano is a european concept italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service).  vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  and if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  sort of awkward in my opinion.\n\nvapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  and while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.\n\nafter my food was prepared, i took the tray to a nearby table.  i placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  bugs and food - not a good combination!  so i changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  i don't know, but since i already had my food, i chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as i could.  guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  the moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.\n\nthe last table i selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  the drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  while pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.  a simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!\n\nas i left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  i mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  had she heard it before?  did she not care?  i paid and left.\n\ninsects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  this location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.\n\ni give this vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but zero stars for cleanliness. great food. i had the calzone. my friends had the caesar salad and sandwich. great atmosphere. lots of eye candy cooks. will go back.", "6sheMoVcv6xrs1E7-bNPZQ": "we came here on a saturday afternoon. i got the veggies with homemade ranch (i love ranch). and the boytoy got a double bacon

there seemed to be one waiter and one busboy on duty.  the waiter seated us and then vanished.  my husband finally went over to the coffee station, brought the pot  to our table and filled our empty cups.  the coffee was fair -- not great.  we eventually saw the waiter, at the back of the room talking on his cell phone.  after a wait of nearly half an hour, we were getting up to leave.  the busboy suddenly appeared and took our order.\n\nour meal arrived quickly.  the busboy who brought our food dropped the containers of jam onto the floor, picked them up, stacked them back in their little holder and put them onto our table.  needless to say, we skipped the jam.  we asked repeatedly for butter for our toast & biscuit, and finally my husband headed for the kitchen to find some.  he was intercepted by the busboy, who brought butter.  by this time, our toast & biscuit were stone cold.\n\nmy veggie omelet was so greasy that i couldn't eat it.  my biscuit was obviously a pre-packaged item, which had been split and toasted on the grill in an apparent effort to make it seem fresh.\n\nmy husband's scrambled eggs and sausage were ok -- nothing special.  the bacon strips were curled up in little balls ... apparently no one in the kitchen knows how to cook bacon.  the sliced tomato was good.\n\nthe menu is enormous.  based on our experience this morning, i would guess

think! what a great chocolate coma i had the rest of the day.  \n\nbesides the great product, what i was really impressed with was the friendly staff. i got a lot of great information and tips from the woman who helped me, and she was more than happy to give me and my family plenty of samples and suggestions. those of you that read my reviews know how much i appreciate great service like this. and as a little epilogue, the other day i received a letter in the mail from the shop, which contained a hand-written note thanking me for my patronage and included a coupon for store and online use.

of it that way. there were some rude international folks that feel like they have to fight you for bargains, i.e. grab items that were in front of you... so be prepared for that! its pretty busy in there every time i go, and the line is also long, but worth it to save some money. they usually have a good amount of cashiers working. some of the staff is really nice, others are not. some are just terrible. there was this one lady putting a basket of sunglasses on the rack. a customer next to me, reached across me to grab into the basket. the employee told her she couldn't do that and that she would have to wait for her to set them on the rack. which i understand, because the glasses would be all over the floor if the customer went diving into them. the funny part ....as the employee was filling the rack, she took her time and spun the freshly placed sunglasses towards the wall, away from that lady. the customer looked so mad. i kind of smiled at her while we waited and she glared back at me. it was a funny situation, and i don't blame the employee for doing that but its not the best customer service you get there. overall i was happy with my experience and purchase there and

heart of yorkville. for a tuesday night, it was pretty busy but certainly not full. the food was not bad, not the best i've ever had but definitely above average and the service was pretty good!\n\ni had a glass of the pinot grigio which i enjoyed. i notice the list of white wines was a bit smaller. there were a lot more red wine choices and most of the choices were for entire bottles. the prices were a bit on the higher side but it's a beautiful restaurant in yorkville so that's to be expected.\n\ni had the spinach salad which was good but i found there were too many sweet elements. the salad dressing was a strawberry vinaigrette and there were figs and dried cranberries and some sort of crispy onions and bocconcini cheese. i would have enjoyed a goats cheese or something to cut the sweetness of it. the elements were fresh tasting however. we also ordered the burrata appetizer that came with a sizable ball of burrata cheese and prosciutto on a bed of arugula. the burrata was delicious and the portion was good for the price. \n\ni had the gnocchi as my main, which while was filling, was a small portion on a huge plate. i saw some other dishes like the lasagna and pizzas and panzerotti and they were a lot larger. maybe i'd go with one of those options next time. the pasta was also somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the sauce wasn't the best and the ricotta on top didn't really add much to it. \n\nsince we were there for a birthday, we also got a nutella pizza to share. i love nutella so that was good but i found the crust to be really chewy in some parts and burnt in other parts. there were also a total of 5 banana slices on the pizza and a few hazelnuts sprinkles on top. it was a nice after dinner treat but it wasn't amazing. \n\nthe service was pretty good. the food came a bit slow but it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect that. the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. modern and warm and stylish. the kitchen is open so you can see the pizzas being made which is really cool. \n\noverall this is a nice spot for dinner. the prices are on the higher side but not outrageously so, especially for the area. it's definitely a cool, stylish place

did,  it was amazing. the chicken was crispy with a nice crunch with every bite and did i mentioned the garlic.  it was so delicious!\n\nthe xl pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom

amazing food is available in vegas, beso sucks some major donkey balls. the various managers are completely useless.  the manager we got to \"work\" with chad jahn is beyond useless. the consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.\n\nthere seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  i saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  none of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. there were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. \n\nnow, onto the food. again, wow. it was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  apparently our ticket got dropped twice by the kitchen. and, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? uh, that'd be a no.\n\nthat's where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here chad came over. and he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  instead, we told him what we expected from our service. comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. at least he had the competency to do that, so i guess there is some hope. but, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. isn't that a manager's job?\n\nthe waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? i think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. we made sure they were compensated for their work. as for the main tab? aw hale naw.  took whatever discount they gave us. normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  the sad thing is? even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out and it wasn't good.\n\nthe one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.\n\nfinal report: more style than substance. we've eaten years 3 times: the first shortly after

10 pm. unfortunately, we stayed...\n\ni sat my reading glasses case down on the table when we arrived. when i went to pick it up to read the menu, it was practically stuck to the table. classy, eh?

server informed me there was no tabasco and was walking away when i called after him asking if they had any other hot sauce instead. he grudgingly brought another very spicy sauce and spent the remainder of the evening cleaning tables, stacking chairs and generally making it clear that he wanted us out of there asap. i did manage to request a glass of water from him as he reached across the table mid-meal to remove our candle. the lights were very bright, so i asked another server if they could be turned down. after asking if i wanted to go to sleep (!), she turned them down just a touch, but a few minutes later our waiter turned them on full blast. by this point the place had less ambiance than your average mcdonalds at 3 am. no one ever inquired if we were happy with our food (we were not). the hot sauce i'd begged for added the only taste. the 'quesadilla' was practically an empty tortilla. i know where to find much better tacos and enchiladas in toronto for less money.

can't afford it so how much to just pull it?\n\nwell, then in walks the finance manager (sounds just like a car dealership) she details all the options from crowns to partials. thousands of dollars she's quoting. i tell her how much for just pulling the damn tooth.\n\nok, she explains in order to quote that, since i don't have dental insurance i would have to buy a 1 year dental plan through them that would cost $95. that would entitle me to their \"discount\" procedure rate of $300 to pull the tooth. $300!!! plus the $95 plus the initial $39 and i'm looking at almost $450 to pull a simple tooth!\n\nwell, needless to say i said no.\n\neven though i paid the $39 (demanded up front when i walked in) which was supposed to include a cleaning and free sonic toothbrush, i was offered

them by showing cara's review because the wife loves pad thai where i personally have never tried it.  mridul was limited to chicken, chicken, or chicken so pp (ha) was right down his alley.\n\nfor

whole dish basically reddish orange with sprinkled peanuts and sprouts because i really couldn't tell the difference between the noodles and the carrots.....again, this is my first time here so i quickly realize what a rookie i was.  mridul went with the chicken fried rice, medium spice, with a scrambled egg inside.  this was really good too, a dish i would recommend if a rice dish is your desire.  i went with the spicy pork pad thai medium heat for 2 reasons.   1) i originally wanted the chicken but wifey beat me to it and 2) i wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference between chicken and pork, which upon tasting, there really was.  although all dishes were great, we all decided that the spicy chicken pad thai was our favorites.  we also all decided that the heat needed to be upgraded to the medium level, not mild.  \n\nwhat a great first time.  i will be back and also want to try pad thai somewhere else to see how it compares.  very cute place, and really reasonable.

[most chinese places i've been to are completely opposite of this] also for a saturday night they didn't have many people. [saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]\n\nsome of the issues i found:\n1. the booths are quite old. if someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. this is quite bothersome, and i had to move because of this reason. \n2. price, it wasn't that bad. it was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.\n3. service: i have no complaints. i'm not very picky on service, so i have no complaints.\n4. value: for the quality, i wouldn't say the value is very high. they did give a lot of quantity.\n5. the food. this is the thing that bothered me the most. the tangerine chicken was just chicken. there weren't any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. the chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. the chicken is covered in \"brown sauce.\" the cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. \n\nhow could the food have been better. inapc [i'm not a professional chief], but:\n1. balance out the dish. add less deep fried items to the dish. i had never gotten an typical chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn't have some kind of vegetables. \n2. there was no citrus flavor. if you want the flavor you're going to have to put it in the sauce. it is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. the chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. \n3. don't reuse the sauce. create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won't make it spicy. add heat to the dish and stick by it. if it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy.", "Wv_qGcUKptXkapn8e3j6Kg": "i am an ubereats delivery driver.  i arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  there was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  the manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  at no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  after 8 minutes of standing there, i finally locked on and said hey, is the ubereats order ready yet?  \n\nhis response to me was \"you should have spoken up, i can't read your mind\".  this response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction i have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  this man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  this is whom they are taking their cues from.  \n\nso, i will speak up.  greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  and customer service is the business you are in, mr. manager.  your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  i have the answer, and the answer is yes.  \n\ni will never again do a food delivery at this location.  i can guarantee you i am not the only one, because often times i am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  really?  there's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  there is a reason!

for some oil to add to it and felt that that was really a just so-so solution.  i doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.  \nour pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was so overdone.  normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and so mushy and starchy and tasteless. the server explained something that i really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  while we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  but - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was not true. we didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and i didn't look closely at it until i got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. so that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better. yikes, the prices are crazy for what it is and what you get.  if you are going to charge $18-22 for an entr\u00e9e an all the salads are a la carte, you should have at least linen napkins.  the waitress is the hostess, no salt or pepper on table, and entry is messy.  the food was a tremendous disappointment and with one waitress on a sunday night, we had to wait for just about everything.  food was overcooked and just weird.  the fried zucchini and spanokapitos were good, but entr\u00e9es were tiny and just not tasty.  for six people our bill was

i had no choice as the price went up again.  so i switched to twc. the second year, it went up that understood, after promotion.  to save trouble of payment, i set up auto- pay, this year it went up again.  i called to understand the reason.  their customer service was so rude with a prima donna attitude.  she even insulted me over the phone as i didn't want all the services. since i stayed for a week of less each month, it's unjustified for me to pay close to $100.  i simply kept my expenses but the service reduced to 1/10 of the speed that i had.  i'm looking for another provider if there is. \nfor all these years, i've seen more adverse comments than favorable comments to twc.  most business respect prestige customers or those stay with them for years. but not twc.  they believe customers can't live without them in charlotte.  that's why i've seen salesmen knocking at our doors every season like the 50s to look for new customers.\ni'm sure if twc's upper management can make a

says that on the menu. we offered to pay for a side of shrimp if it was an issue,  but the manager just said it was ok and walked away... the conversation between the manager and the elderly man after

their seafood is sort of a hit or miss.\n\noverall, it's meant to be a greek restaurant style, but it's more so greek food for the asian demographic. \n\noverall, my general impression is that the chef doesn't quite get the delicacy of the seafood is working with yet cooks it to perfection. the scallops in pesto - over powering and the oil tastes stale. the octopus - grilled perfectly but the tabuleh and humus and pomegranate - too much and not well done. the tuna - served on seaweed salad....doesn't fit on the same plate as pickerel with sweet mash....very confusing and very strong flavours.\n\nbut what they do right are the classics. great deal on oysters - though i found the shucking to be a little poor - but when you're paying essentially $1.50 a shuck, you accept that.  the lavraki however - now this is the star of their menu. it's exceptional. no confusion - classic greek prepartion - the gril, some salt, some lemon and olive oil. the protein sings and the grill accents. \n\nmy honest recommendation - just go for some oysters and lavraki and you'll have an excellent night. the rest is just confusing fluff.", "OJZlwt18PpLg5Wy5_UPBxQ": "i wish i could give 10

tuxedos are old and dingy! the white shirts have stains and some of the pants have cigarette burns in them! do not put yourself thru the hell we went thru with this lady and go elsewhere!!! save yourself the frustration!!!", "1_WfF9pNoNeWe233CeqE1Q": "i am convinced that everyone giving this place good reviews must be confusing this with somewhere else, or its the same people that keep terrible places like macayo's in business.  i ate here a while ago, and i thought i would give it a second chance last week. it was still bad. if a mexican food place can't make refried beans well, i'm not sure what they can make. they taste like they are straight from the can. for a place that touts all of the other fresh items they serve, some effort on their beans would be nice.  the rice had little flavor. tortilla was ok at best. the prices are not as great as some are saying, especially for this quality. also, not a huge deal but you need to pay 25 cents for a soda refill, this just bothers me.\n\nif you want great mexican food in surprise, go to rito's on reems and greenway. nothing in surprise comes close, especially this place.", "BIMICEFM917JQwi5l4q6Gw": "i lived in northern nj for a couple of years (which in my opinion has the best chinese food out of any state) and this is the only place in surprise, az that comes close. i have had the privilege of meeting the owner and his employees. they are hospitable and make very good food! i do not get chinese food from any other place. good job patrick!", "2pOE6yvSNjJ7RNV5in_nLg": "good portions and good value. we had simple breakfast food. eggs, potatoes and french toast were yummy. we will be back."}
